in the last eight years there has been an amazing erosion of legislative support for traditional marriage , and this in spite of the fact that there is overwhelming evidence showing the benefits of traditional marriage to children , adults and society .

Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Friday , just as her parliamentary secretary was telling the House that , in the case of the audiovisual production affair , the RCMP must be allowed to do its job without any interference , the Minister of Canadian Heritage was saying outside the House that a major administrative investigation had been launched into Telefilm Canada and production tax credits , as the Bloc Quebecois has been demanding since the beginning of this affair .

in 1993 Canadians were suffering under a bloated and arrogant government , one devoid of any new ideas and fundamentally out of touch with the electorate . 
Eurasia and North America are just 50 miles apart at this point and almost touch each other like two fingers reaching out . 
this is a definite loophole , one which I fear the governing party would exploit to its own unfair advantage .

we are not in that situation as we have seen by going to the supreme court on the Marshall decision .

unfortunately , I did not hear the earlier presentation of the petition , but I did hear what Senator Kinsella just said . 
this cost has to be tallied in the houses of government by the democratically elected people who make these decisions . 
each time this occurs it makes me proud . 
as a matter of fact , I remember my old Liberal friend , who was not long ago the premier of Nova Scotia , describe the situation in Cape Breton as an economic crisis . 
the only official language of the parliament of the time was English . 
concerns on the siting and size parameters necessary to protect and conserve marine biological diversity in national marine conservation areas remain unanswered .

Mr. Derrek Konrad 
yeas 
as a matter of fact your visit is quite timely because I have a story to tell you '' . 
we are grown up enough in the country to stop the practice of the Prime Minister toying around with the electorate for the clear advantage of the ruling party by requiring in the future that byelections be held within six months of vacancies arising in the House .

that funding is in addition to the $ 1 billion the federal and provincial governments contribute each year to the safety net programs , including crop insurance and the net income stabilization account which cushion farmers during difficult times , and those programs which invest in marketing research and other initiatives which serve to strengthen the sector .

adjournment 
Mr. Speaker , following the introduction by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs of a bill denying the fundamental rights of Quebecers , I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to table this document , which will no doubt enlighten it .

this problem is not isolated to this particular case .

i have witnessed first hand the pain , discouragement and financial suffering of victims of hepatitis C in my riding . 
the Prime Minister is clearly unaware of the impressions and the questions he is generating among taxpayers because of the HRD billion dollar bungle . 
what I also said was that the Indian Act is silent on women ' s rights and it is an issue we will be dealing with . 
how can we get the message to people in the cities to recognize this problem and assist us in the solution ? 
how about Bill C - 110 ? 
honourable senators , I have the honour to table , in both official languages , the report of the 29 th annual meeting of the Canadian group of the Canada - France Inter - Parliamentary Association , held from September 8 to September 15 , 1999 in Montreal , Laval , Ottawa , Vancouver and Victoria .

the hon. member for Okanagan - Shuswap on a point of order . 
honourable senators , I also question the need for Bill C - 247 , given the changes to the Criminal Code in 1996 regarding high - risk offenders . 
but how does he explain that it kept no tabs at all on a $ 500,000 grant to Wal - Mart for several months ? 
yet , absolutely unbelievable cuts were made to transfers to the provinces for health care . 
No. 
that did not come from the Reform Party . 
Mr. Speaker , that question is totally strange , because , as I said , we worked with GM to save jobs at Boisbriand . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 408 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
Mr. Speaker , that would be a great new story again except for the fact that according to the terms and conditions she cannot delegate that authority . 
the important thing to remember here is the maxim of the wisest of common law legal philosophers , Jeremy Bentham . 
who should be saved , the baby or the mother ? 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to rise in the House today to speak about people , plants and pride , the slogan of Communities in Bloom , an organization which seeks to provide a national focus for established provincial and community based beautification programs across Canada . 
honourable senators , I thank the honourable senator for the question . 
it would be a lot less expensive , a lot less costly to elect the nine supreme court justices and to ask them , as they have the monopoly of truth , to legislate as they see fit , which might not always be how the people really want it . 
that left 16 days for a company , an investor , a group of investors or consortiums to come up with a package involving $ 6 billion . 
to ram through the Nisga ' a treaty in Parliament may be to unravel the Supreme Court of Canada initiative undertaken by the federal government in the case of Quebec secession . 
we have heard in the media and in the House about the projects that have been approved across the country , how they have benefited the various ridings . 
while I raise these concerns about the current drafting of the bill , I want to emphasize that New Democrats will go into the committee stage with open minds . 
her presence here today tells us how far we have come as a nation . 
objections to this bill will come from those who fear that it is but the thin edge of the wedge which in time will lead to the end of the ceremonial as we know it today . 
motion No. 117 negatived 
i met the government negotiators in this particular case and I was impressed by their dedication , their hard work and their open mindedness . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not know what memo the member is referring to . 
a member of the opposition says there is too much bureaucracy . 
the problem with this is that it has given some people the false sense that all first nations are poorly managed , when in fact many first nations manage themselves extremely well . 
Canadians are justifiably proud of having built communities where citizens feel safe . 
they are asking if they will be able to fish next spring . 
to conclude my comments today , Bill C - 9 does nothing to repair the damage caused by the 100 plus years of the reserve system . 
it did not protect northern regions . 
it is part of the constitution . 
Mr. Gordon Earle : 
volume 138 , Issue 15 
we had to deal first with a $ 42 billion deficit .

i listened with much interest to the speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice - I find it all odd that the minister did not come to the House to defend the bill herself at second reading , instead of her parliamentary secretary - but I think he has failed to grasp the problem . 
it puts into practice the values of Canadians from coast to coast to coast . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for her question .

and it is the president of the Chambre des notaires who is speaking .

how does this hurt Canadian families , Canadian entrepreneurs and Canadian investors ? 
powers of clemency rightfully belong with the clemency granting agencies . 
they knew who was the Prime Minister . 
just wait on Bill C - 9 . 
the Government of Canada has the mandate under the constitution to enter into treaties of this nature . 
while there can be levels of services , common initiatives and exchanges in that area , there is no need for a superstructure such as the Canadian tourism commission , which will get involved in jurisdictions where Quebec is already very active . 
petitioners from the Grand Bend , Lucan and Strathroy areas have signed the said petition . 
some would like not to be held accountable , but our whole system of parliamentary democracy is based upon the principle of ministerial accountability . 
in the meantime we are working on a process that will accommodate both commercial and native fisheries for years to come . 
in the particular case of the Nisga ' a agreement , we have a form of government that is apart from all other governments .

Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
this bill is almost racist .

they certainly deserve protection and they have received it . 
i think the government was right in putting it to a legislative committee , because clearly there was no other standing committee that could possibly have the jurisdiction over a question like this . 
introduction and first reading 
we believe that passing legislation to ensure swift implementation of the new provisions will save lives .

i am not sure I have the numbers right but if my memory serves me correctly , I believe that in total the Liberal government had in the 1997 election a spending limit of around $ 30 million .

if the member for Wentworth - Burlington would dig into the short path , he would clearly see that there have been hidden agendas in other bills that have come before the House .

this is a concrete measure that the government and parliamentarians will have to adopt some day if they are serious about learning from the past . 
it is the acts of violence that strike fear in the hearts of the elderly and the children who endure the harassment and brutality of a generation held unaccountable for its actions . 
clearly , when someone breaks the law and commits a heinous crime , it has to be dealt with swiftly , in a meaningful way as stated in the act and in some cases severely . 
the governor in council is the cabinet . 
Mr. Derek Lee 
Mr. Speaker , I want to assure the member and all members in the House that voting is a fundamental right of our democracy . 
the only country is Canada , the best place in the world in which to live , for everybody except farmers . 
a lot of that is coming right out of the pockets of farmers .

then , when the travel agents ' association wanted to meet with the airlines to discuss the rate structure , it was threatened with anti - competition charges under the Competition Act by the very same airline . 
why does the minister not just give Andy his Christmas bonus instead of the Christmas goose ? 
similarly the task of addressing the problem of youth crime requires a clear sense of purpose and values and the capacity to respond to the individual situations of each youth and his place in the community . 
again , I wonder if there is some way of augmenting this marriage counselling undertaking to give it more impact and force when children are involved . 
moreover , tax conventions contribute to the fairness of the tax system by ensuring that Canadians are not subject to double taxation , a situation that may arise when a taxpayer lives in a country but earns an income in another country . 
why are they not guaranteed seats on the board of directors of the Royal Bank of Canada , for example ? 
the taking of bodily substances always raises significant constitutional issues . 
Mr. Speaker , if the government would listen to Reform today , farmers would have the support they need . 
this event is put forth to recognize the importance of our children . 
my job is to build a strong foundation of administration to support the grants and contributions that are so valuable to Canadians . 
on motion of Senator Hervieux - Payette , report placed on the Orders of the Day for consideration at the next sitting of the Senate .

hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
that Bill C - 9 , in Clause 13 , be amended by replacing lines 9 and 10 on page 5 with the following : 
tens of millions of dollars in fuel taxes that could be used to upgrade our system stay in the United States , together with the costs of lodging , meals , repairs and incidentals . 
in fact , if we follow the argument advanced by Senator Fraser last Thursday to its logical conclusion , we will have a two - tier legislative system in Parliament . 
it was our party that advised the minister to negotiate with all stakeholders and introduce an implementation plan with conservation as the first priority . 
for Quebec , this arrangement comprises essentially a transfer of management to the Soci é t é d ' habitation du Qu é bec for all social housing funded by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation . 
i am surprised that the he is coming so close to the previous hon. member who spoke . 
some hon. members : 
what the Reform Party is saying right here and now is that it wants more federal intervention and more federal money for the provinces . 
our concern is that it is very loosely worded and not clearly prescribed in the legislation . 
i know how important intellectual properties are . 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
we have every intention of keeping our promise to the Nisga ' a people , to the mayor of Terrace and to the politicians in that region who support it . 
she is pursuing her studies in political science at the Faculty of Public Affairs and Management at Carleton University . 
the SENATE 
that the government should take action to remedy its overzealous and irresponsible pursuit of greater trade liberalization , which has caused extreme hardship for Canadian farmers - 
we have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in that committee to work on that study on our behalf - and I want all honourable senators to know that . 
port OF VANCOUVER 
i won ' t sit down . 
if the minister asks me what is the value of this rule , my response would be that he should tell me what is the cost of the 10 % rule to the airlines and therefore to their consumers . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
seasons greetings to CF members , their families and Canadians everywhere . 
the government talks frequently about the infrastructure program . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
animal Protection Legislation 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien ( Frontenac - M é gantic , BQ ) : 
it drives prices up . 
it is clearly a situation where it is parliament restraining the power of future governments . 
hon. David M. Collenette 
the Leader of the Government in the Senate will know the consequences of such a decision or position . 
members 
more than likely Ronald Reagan ' s is no longer busy now , so it is taking up some Reform and getting into that type of business . 
Ms. Diane St - Jacques 
i would suggest that most of the time it will be government that is actually in violation of its own act , in violation of its own laws . 
i sincerely hope that this issue will be examined in depth at committee . 
i hate to interrupt but I want to point out something for the record before we start debate on the motion . 
another challenge relates to the creation of new rules . 
canada ELECTIONS ACT 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien 
i ask a question and I do not prejudge the outcome but everyone can draw their own conclusions . 
it would give us a mark in the world as being on the leading edge of needed health care research . 
i do not think it is a question of " blurring the line " . 
that should a division be deferred until 5:30 p.m. today , the Speaker shall interrupt the proceedings at 3:30 p.m. to suspend the sitting until 5:30 p.m. for the taking of the deferred division ; and 
i urge all my colleagues who have industrious self - employed workers in their ridings wanting to take part in the democratic process to allow them to do so by voting for this amendment . 
the other issue which is directly tied to health research is the brain drain . 
honourable senators , I thank the honourable senator for the question and I appreciate the support that she has for the program . 
Mr. Speaker , I wonder if you and Mr. Lalonde sat in the House at the same time . 
motion No. 5 negatived 
the Speaker : 
this announcement immediately raised howls of protest and despair from Cape Breton as mining is all many Cape Bretoners have ever known . 
consequently , I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to table this document . 
No. 
the Deputy Speaker : 
he vowed to fight his own government tooth and nail on this bill . 
it very simply states that it " requires the judicial record of the conviction to be kept separate and apart from other criminal records '' . 
Mr. Ken Epp 
there is a litany of problems in this regard . 
hon. Senators : 
we are simply respecting the supreme court ruling . 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 396 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act ( donors to food banks ) . 
it would have a board that would be co - chaired by the federal minister , along with the provincial and territorial ministers . 
it talks about those who built this great country , who devoted so much time and energy and who sacrificed so much in order to foster the spiritual and cultural growth of our community and the country . 
instead of putting up a shiny new office that million dollars could have provided emergency shelter for 30,000 homeless Canadians . 
almost every major U.S. petroleum producer , the minister said , had indicated support for the decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to forbid MMT being marketed as a gasoline additive '' . 
i would like to know where the member stands on what the secretary of state said . 
it does not impact on you . " 
there is the Young Offenders Act . 
it is very disturbing when a person makes $ 65,000 and he can barely make it because of the tax burden imposed by the government . 
the second and most important point is that in the throne speech we indicated our commitment to the enhancement of the infrastructure in the rural and urban areas of the country . 
by tomorrow , when she makes her announcement , it will have been 267 days . 
we make up those organizations . 
for once , Mr. Pierre Gravel was of the opinion that we were doing our work by creating a filibuster to stop Bill C - 82 in its tracks , because , among other things , the bill provided life sentences for impaired driving causing death . 
what is fair for the goose is fair for the gander . 
how can this minister stand in her place and not tell the truth , that her riding did not - 
Mr. Speaker , I propose that all motions which are selected for debate now and later be deemed to have been moved , seconded and read . 
the Government of Canada , through the Department of Justice , should institute a study - 
however , security services are being cut , even though we have had fatal accidents . 
i do not think I could speak as knowledgeably today if I had not experienced life on their land . 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay 
Mr. Speaker , if the reference is to briefings for journalists , these are certainly not secret briefings . 
that was also regarded as an attack upon the institution of marriage . 
what has happened now is they have said that they will leave it up to the individual chiefs . 
U.S. border state politicians are increasing their rhetoric and are once again starting to rattle their trade sabres , threatening the livelihood of Canadian agricultural producers . 
some provinces cannot afford to do more . 
the Liberals just cannot stand the notion of freedom of speech . 
it is absolutely astonishing when we hear , and when the Canadian public hears , that there are companies which received money that did not even fill out an application . 
i am asking for unanimous consent to do that . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
the 301 members of the House are part of the legislative branch and will be able to express their views and vote on this issue . 
this government wants to ensure that children are equipped with all the capacities they need to be ready to learn when they begin school and to grow into healthy productive adults . 
another amendment concerns electronic voting . 
can Canada work to ensure the primacy of the United Nations in resolving conflict ? 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased today to speak to Bill C - 2 , the Canada Elections Act . 
the Late Sandra Schmirler 
i want to ask the member what his concerns are . 
at about the same time , successive governments began mandating Devco to attain commercial viability . 
Mr. Speaker , I do not comment on RCMP investigations . 
that is what he said . 
quite simply , when I was appointed Solicitor General of Canada , 70 % of the people in our federal institutions were alcoholics or had drug problems . 
( 2 ) The committee designated or established for the purpose of subsection ( 1 ) shall , as soon as practicable , undertake a comprehensive review of the provisions and operation of this Act and shall , within two years after the review is undertaken , submit a report to the Senate . " 
the government appreciates the hon. member ' s concern for the national highway system and commends him for bringing this matter to the attention of the House . 
hon. Michel Cogger : 
is he committed to doing it ? 
the senators sitting across from me - Senator Perrault and Senator Austin , both of whom are from British Columbia - know how badly this agreement has been dealt with . 
that is what Canadians were seriously horrified about .

it is very complex out there and our embassies struggle with a variety of people .

the fact that he is appointed by the party in office creates a serious problem . 
member after member of that party are defecting and resigning because they cannot tolerate the positions being taken . 
from the 1920 s to the 1950 s , the Nisga ' a and other first nations ' efforts to have their rights recognized and practise their culture were restricted . 
nays 
* * * 
madam Speaker , the bill specifically recognizes the legitimacy of this movement by stating that any province can ask any question it wishes , but it would seek clarity on both the question and the majority . 
the EI clause , introduced in 1993 , goes a long way towards explaining why the rate of coverage for young people between the ages of 20 and 24 has dropped from 49.1 % in 1993 to 26.6 % in 1998 . 
Mr. Speaker , further to the introduction of a bill denying the fundamental rights of Quebecers , I have here parts of a report on the territorial integrity of the province of Quebec in the event that it achieves sovereignty , presented to the committee to examine matters relating to the accession of Qu é bec to sovereignty in May of 1992 , at the Quebec national assembly , which states that a sovereign Quebec would undergo no changes in its present boundaries . 
banking , Trade and Commerce 
Mr. Ryan added furthermore that , by wanting to make parliament the arbiter of clarity in the referendum question and result , contrary to the prerogatives of the National Assembly , the Liberal government was contravening the very principles of democracy . 
Mr. Speaker , I think you will see on page 244 of Beauchesne ' s that there is such a thing as the indivisibility of the Crown principle . 
i have taken part in such negotiations . 
i believe that you would find , Mr. Speaker , consent for the following motion : 
i will comment briefly on the importance of ongoing communication between the government and the public . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
members 
when I restated that I was the surviving spouse she asked for my name and " the name of the deceased '' . 
Mr. Speaker , I have here the speech the Prime Minister of Canada delivered in Hull on November 28 , 1999 , where he says that the referendum questions , both in 1980 and in 1995 , were clear . 
this could very easily create a paradise environment for lawyers . 
this successful company employs close to 3,000 people worldwide . 
in Quebec , we are determined that we will never allow the Liberal government to interfere in our areas of responsibility .

ask a question . 
motion No. 116 
he bragged that there is a limit on the treaty right . 
the moneys set aside for economic adjustment are inadequate even by the government ' s own estimates which placed the need at $ 300 million . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Canadians are confident in their economy and they are confident in their government . 
we can put in place all the RCMP and all the police assistance that we want in communities , but we must address the basic fundamental attitudes of young people and tell them that they have to respect one another . 
members 
i congratulate my colleagues from Bras d ' Or - Cape Breton and Acadie - Bathurst for having worked strenuously to achieve that kind of commitment from the government . 
government RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
the finance committee will now be out . 
also , the ramifications of this decision will be with us , our children and our children ' s children for generations . 
my question relates to the status of Inter - Canadian Inc. , Canada ' s largest independent regional air carrier . 
members of the Canadian heritage committee , along with many witnesses who made presentations to the committee , helped identify a number of glaring weaknesses within the legislation . 
we did so in a spirit of co - operation , knowing that for young people across Canada we could bring the best from all areas including Quebec and do so in a very positive way . 
that fact goes to the very heart of our history , of our existence as a country . 
addressing their needs and ensuring their safety have involved many agencies in our communities : government and social services , law enforcement , and as voluntary and non - profit organizations . 
a recent article in Le Devoir about the health of seniors in Quebec described the situation facing the province ' s beleaguered Department of Health and Social Services : 
from a personal point of view , the fact that Canada is continuing its involvement in space is somewhat gratifying in the sense that my uncle is considered one of Canada ' s space pioneers . 
motion No. 18 
( the House divided on the motion , which was agreed to on the following division : ) 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
Quebec - Possible Conditions of Referendum - Role of Senate 
i will read directly from the Debates of the Senate . 
Mr. Jim Pankiw 
i declare Motion No. 4 lost . 
if context needs to be provided , then a summary section is the standard practice . 
in other words , why bring a bill to us telling us that we have no power ? 
if he would understand farmers at all in western Canada he would know that they are well - educated people . 
this is the same man who signed the treaty of 1760 . 
Mr. Ken Epp : 
it is underhanded and it is simply wrong . 
every time they try to escape from the dependence in which they are trapped , they must seek the minister ' s permission . 
i was fascinated to hear about his research on hepatitis B , which was conducted in a Canadian institute at a very high level . 
government MPs spent six months telling the Premier of British Columbia that it was not a template , that it rested on its own particular historical facts . 
the government said no , the committee should not travel . 
these are the words of a great Quebecer with vast experience in political and federal politics whose integrity and political judgment have earned him the esteem of his fellow citizens regardless of political stripe . 
for example , criminal charges were laid in September of this year against a refiner and two retailers of gasoline for price maintenance . 
keynote speakers included renowned medical researcher and early childhood development expert , Dr. Fraser Mustard ; Dr. John Wootton , Executive Director of the Office of Rural Health for Health Canada ; and our eminent colleague and children ' s issues advocate , the hon. member for Don Valley West . 
i will be splitting my time . 
section 237 would also accord greater strength to the charter of rights and for Canadians to enjoy property . 
members 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
members 
that is what we need , not a bunch of ridiculous programs that come forward , as we have seen in the past from this government , such as TAGS . 
members of the NDP are trying to justify their position . 
what a joke . 
Mr. Speaker , if my hon. colleague wanted an answer he could have informed me of the situation before question period . 
i am disgusted at the Liberal government and its total disregard for the democratic process in the House . 
we need to honour our heroes . 
senator Grafstein : 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
the answer yesterday evening at 7 p.m. was " Never , there is no question of it '' . 
she has listened to a wide range of views on the matter in order to come up with a solution to this problem . 
it is as if there had been no committee hearings at all with respect to this bill . 
when properly structured , they may provide roads at a lower cost and more quickly than traditional procurement methods .

i am sorry to interrupt the hon. parliamentary secretary , but time has run out . 
presence IN GALLERY 
under Bill C - 8 , each department will have jurisdiction over its own areas or zones . 
we are asking the court to rule , as I said , that the treaty , the Nisga ' a final agreement , is unconstitutional on each of those grounds . 
it is certainly not a point of order . 
in my view , if we carry this forward to 60 agreements there will not be a commercial fishery in Canada . 
Checkmate . 
it seems the Liberal government has devised a new process for drafting the budget this year . 
this proposal strikes us as a bit strange . 
i am wondering if Senator Murray could explain the apparent change in position . 
we know that when the auditor general criticizes something the government has done , the public listens to him . 
honourable senators , these Main Estimates support the government ' s request for Parliament ' s authority to spend $ 50.1 billion under program authorities for which annual approval is required . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
in fact , Canadians were shut out of the committee hearings . 
once the way was paved , a movement started to emerge . 
there are other reasons for setting out the circumstances under which the Government of Canada would negotiate around a referendum result . 
at the same time as it does that , the advisory panel also has absolutely no teeth connected with it . 
the hon. member indicated that a lawsuit was launched against him by a senator following the distribution to his constituents of a bulk mailing of 16 pages on the subject of the Senate . 
i say to my friends opposite , what evidence do we have of the impact of globalization ? 
in 1986 , Ontario became the second province , after Quebec , to amend its human rights code , which is the equivalent of Quebec ' s charter of human rights , and to include sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination . 
but once you had stood up , you said that the member for Chambly was seated and had not asked for the floor , when all I was doing was complying with the standing orders . 
given that this bill has been supported by all parties in the other place , by provincial and territorial ministers of justice and law enforcement authorities throughout Canada , I believe it merits our support . 
she got away from the treaty and began working in a hospital in the Beaverlodge area . 
without his determined efforts we would not be here today . 
in 1993 , also an important year , the government opposite came to power in October of that year . 
Mr. Eric Lowther 
Mr. Speaker , the lobster season only opened yesterday for lobster fishing areas 33 and 34 in Nova Scotia and already the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has shown how unprepared he and his department are . 
members 
it is the result of close to 25 years of negotiations . 
why would we have points within a bill that we know the courts will reject ? 
( the House adjourned at 2.31 p.m. ) 
as a matter of fact , that is one of the main planks of the Reform Party ' s policy . 
Mr. Speaker , I met with the ministers of agriculture from two western provinces today . 
some hon. members : 
Mr. Janko Peric 
i fail to understand why it was not felt advisable to try to use them as a point of departure for drafting legislation that meets the needs of Canadians in several respects where the Code , which , as you know is a compromise , might not be up to the task '' . 
bill C - 4 . 
perhaps the Republicans should check the historical record to see what eventually happens to empires which trust more in their weapons than in the will of God for a just , peaceful and non - nuclear world . 
in the opinion of the Chair , there should be two speeches of unlimited time . 
the first ones to make that assessment would be the government of the province . 
( k ) to those honours , distinctions , and awards that are not hereditary in character such as life peerages , knighthoods , military and chivalrous orders ; and 
citizens around the globe realize that there is a cost to making trade the first and foremost consideration over the protection of the environment that supports us . 
members 
in fact this agreement will guarantee that the Nisga ' a people will see another hundred years of poverty in their communities . 
members 
division No. 202 
we have much left to do . 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
the selection of returning officers is also an issue that will have to be addressed . 
this is one more in a series of similar petitions signed by thousands in my riding and in the ridings of a number of other members who have presented similar petitions in the House . 
in all fairness the minister and his officials would probably read and study the recommendation . 
i raise this point in the proceedings to give the government fair warning that it is completely dissatisfying the people of the country and the members of the House with its arrogant treatment of committees . 
that is what we should have done , but I am afraid it will have to be done in another bill . 
we are , therefore , sensitive to the pain of those Canadians who may at one time have been victimized by the inhumanity of war , or by bigotry and oppression . 
business OF THE HOUSE 
the court further stated : " While we recognize their right '' - third parties - `` to participate in the electoral process , independent individuals and groups cannot be subject to the same financial rules as candidates or political parties and be allowed the same spending limits . 
i happen to represent a riding in the province of Manitoba . 
the flag was presented to me on the understanding that I would present it to the minister . 
they are rewarded . 
i will be referring later to some very distinguished Canadians who believe that Bill C - 20 in no way infringes upon the rights of provincial legislatures to do as they wish in framing questions . 
i can only wonder why the member for Davenport is trying to upset this balance that we have now achieved on the coast of British Columbia . 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) : 
some hon. members : 
" Nisga ' a Final Agreement . " 
the federal Solicitor General , with the support of the Minister of Justice , undertook at the 1998 meeting to determine how best to do this , in consultation with provincial partners . 
one example is that $ 1 million will go to the United Nations for fuel for heating systems in Pristina which will provide about 40 % of the city ' s heat , including hospitals and schools . 
he will not propose any changes . 
the Export Development Corporation is in strange position . 
i have gone so far as to say - and I would say this if we had a Conservative government , an NDP government or a Reform government - that if something is not done , and there is an accident , responsibility will lie directly on cabinet , the Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defence . 
motion No. 297 negatived 
hopefully high ranking scientists will be allowed to make decisions without interference from the government .

you would know Mac Wilson from Renfrew . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough 
in Ontario , the provincial government eliminated its business occupancy tax . 
reporting waste in initiatives that the government has strongly supported and publicized can be more problematic . 
she would hand out these cards . 
we have a quorum . 
that is what is wrong and that is what is relevant with this bill . 
Mr. Joe McGuire 
one important exception , mainly amendments introduced dealing with questions as to the certainty of future benefits , the final agreement passed in the British Columbia legislature contained no significant amendment to the agreement in principle tabled in 1996 . 
in times of awareness , more is better . 
they have told me they have looked at the Nisga ' a agreement . 
action is long overdue , as there are now some 6,000 formulated products registered in Canada . 
i therefore whole heartily support their request . 
your predecessor was a president of the Liberal Party , too . 
we all listened intently and politely to the minister . 
an hon. member : 
homelessness differs in communities across Canada and requires a response specific to that community . 
social Affairs , Science & Technology Committee 
do we want to put in place a registry ? 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
it seems like a long time ago , our first caucus in Collingwood , where indeed all members of the Liberals caucus were very , very worried about the state of medical research in this country . 
imagine a country that was hundreds of nations warring within the bosom of a single state . 
honourable senators , I apologize if I took the leader by surprise . 
there was a shift in population in the late 1800 s , driven by missionaries . 
i can assure the member that we will be bearing her remarks and her proposal in mind when this legislation comes forward . 
i think people have heard of him . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
Ms. Val Meredith 
we do not know anything about that . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
i am also hopeful that by the time this debate is over , Canadians in all parts of Canada and members of parliament representing all parts of Canada will understand that this bill and the agreement to which it gives effect have ramifications for them . 
nationally only 36 % of the unemployed qualify for EI benefits . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
we continue to do so . 
the Nisga ' a agreement seems disturbing , surprising , a thorn in the side of our national tranquillity . 
bank ACT 
he is the one mainly responsible for the mess in hospitals , but that does not bother him in the least . 
it would thus agree to members of this House knowing our international obligations and to the enshrinement of a practice that was carried on for a number of years in this House . 
we will see to it , when the time comes for us to introduce amendments , that the bill gives a larger role to the provinces . 
i will conclude by addressing what was not in this speech . 
it was founded in 1938 as the Chair in Poetry , and then in 1984 it became the Consultant . 
however , that is not the way the world is in some parts .

the international community has identified the fight against organized crime as a priority issue . 
it defined " the withdrawal of life - sustaining treatment " as " stopping treatment that has the potential to sustain life " ; for example , removing a respirator . 
of course the stakes are very high ... 
any violation of the parole conditions , which includes the commission of any further crime , but can , and often does , include other conditions such as remaining free of drugs , results in a revocation of parole and the convicted person is sent back to prison to complete their life sentence . 
i suggest that he do so . 
it is to limit competition on the ballot . 
bill C - 326 . 
i am sure that in her study of this matter , the honourable senator is aware that one of the principles at stake is the Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
i think this is something that should be of concern to the justice committee when it comes to act on the motion proposed by the Bloc Quebecois . 
the next question is on Motion No. 287 . 
Mr. Speaker , does the Minister of Health intend to respond to the concerns expressed by his deputy minister and give his officials the appropriate resources to enable them to do their work ? 
Arabism versus Africanism will create contradictions difficult to overcome . 
osteoporosis Month 
why is it that whenever the government makes a mistake , taxpayers end up paying the bill ? 
Mr. Mac Harb 
i would like to know why the Chair prevents the minister from answering before the minister has even decided whether he will answer or hide behind the fact that he does not have to answer . 
some hon. members : 
i think the scientists themselves are looking to the new act to free up dollars for actual research projects and that the money will go into research . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
maintaining and enhancing our standard of living require a comprehensive strategy to take us into the 21 st century . 
my parents ' fight for custody was the scariest thing in the world and it made me realize that marriage is stupid and having kids is something I ' ll never ever do . 
in addition , will the government now review its policy on Cuba , since quiet diplomacy has obviously failed ? 
recognizing the critical impact of diabetes the government recently announced a five year $ 115 million Canadian diabetes strategy to help prevent and control the disease .

at least the framework for an agreement exists and the envoys from neighbouring countries have been active since the beginning of this year . 
ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister ; ministers should be as open as possible with Parliament , refusing to provide information only when disclosure would not be in the public interest - 
the minister has already referred to this . 
could there be some better language ? 
as the government moves into not only a new year but a new decade , a new century , and a new millennium , I would think it would want to do that too . 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities made short work of the Prime Minister ' s simplistic line about the financial problem at Human Resources Development Canada being limited to $ 250 . 
the recommendations in the report reflect very clearly what the representations were . 
i will deviate from my text for a moment .

Mr. Speaker , I am presenting a petition this morning on behalf of the rural mail couriers who work for Canada Post .

hon. Douglas Roche : 
i will conclude by saying that there is no doubt that the federal government should withdraw immediately from the administration of criminal justice and leave it to the provinces . 
i must say that by virtue of having a sign such as this , it reminds me of how much in the trough both the Conservatives and the Liberals are . 
unfortunately , for too many years first nations have not fully enjoyed the benefits of this great land , in part because they have had limited access to fish , forests , minerals and other natural resources .

i want to tell all Canadians that we must protect our environment . 
the Senate committee was not alone in recommending clarification of the criminal law regarding the permissibility of providing , in order to alleviate suffering , treatment that may shorten life . 
in doing so , they will be joining a massive wave of support which has come in from across the country . 
Mr. Mauril B é langer

the Hon. the Speaker : 
money is flowing in from everywhere and has to be distributed . 
that is because of the approach of the government to work in partnership at the community level to focus on the issues that will make a difference for citizens in those ridings to use their skills and abilities to diversify the economy . 
we have to talk about the multifunctionality of agriculture with respect to the environment . 
these clauses are needed whenever a new collective agreement is reached which changes the previous conditions of employment .

this government , the Senate and the House of Commons , the Prime Minister of Canada and the people of Canada , cannot ignore the serious crisis situation facing the agricultural community because it is a very serious national problem for the whole country .

does the minister care enough to get to the bottom of this and clean up this mess by an independent inquiry ?

however , according to our criteria , at least at this time , it does not meet the criteria for an emergency debate today . 
this means that employees and employers will save a further $ 1.2 billion next year , bringing total savings , compared to the rate that prevailed in 1994 , to $ 5.2 billion .

Mr. Speaker , the hon. member refers again to a billion dollars .

in the case of the definition of the terms " children " or " vulnerable persons " , officials of the Department of the Solicitor General answered our concerns as follows : 
it would be different perhaps if we were giving speeches .

Mr. Speaker , the solicitor general has skated very well on the issue so far when he said that he knew immediately of the disclosure .

my colleague from Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough has mentioned the motorcycle gangs that have increased in cities like Montreal . 
instead of closing the fishery , as I mentioned earlier , the minister took the harder road of negotiations . 
i have spoken to veterans who have been left to sit in wet and soiled diapers for the better part of a day due to staff shortages and institutional indifference . 
there is not enough money in Canada for the government to pay out these demands .

Mr. Speaker , on October 27 , 1997 , Human Resources Development Canada had the hon. member for Rosemont approve a project to create 106 jobs in his riding . 
of course at the time the federal government would have denied that . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
there are two points here . 
i agree that Canadians have something to say about the budget . 
the court also found there were no grounds for a claim of discrimination on the basis of differential treatment of rural and urban residents . 
the shadow cast over this program by mismanagement has fueled the Reform Party ' s call for an end to such programs . 
the agreement I was referring to earlier has the force of law . 
he described the limiting of parliamentary debate on the Nisga ' a treaty as an unacceptable slight to British Columbians and to all Canadians . 
in terms of the mechanics of this chamber , could the honourable senator suggest a way in which we and our aboriginal colleagues could put pressure on the other place to meet the commitments , both constitutional or non - constitutional , that are fundamental as values in this Canadian society so that we can be together as one people ? 
will he judge how they have practised medicine ?

the Speaker : 
as I said on several other occasions , there may be good public policy reasons for disclosing information about individuals that is held by governments after 20 years , or sending the information to the archives , but that is not the bill we are debating today . 
however , I have some concerns . 
the secretary - general also suggested that the council consider the deployment of preventive peacekeeping operations such as UNPREDEP in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 1995 , or other preventive monitoring presences , and he noted the need to address hate media assets in situations of ongoing conflict . 
however , many executives and senior management suddenly were laid off , and it was a new experience for them to be unemployed .

my problem is the means the government has taken to reach that goal .

the shareholders of Air Canada will need to reach a decision before long and they must have all of the information in hand with which to make that decision an informed one . 
it is certainly undemocratic . 
well done . 
for instance , we would like to strengthen or improve the exercise of federal legislative and administrative authority in the following areas : defence , foreign affairs , monetary policy , regulation of financial institutions , criminal law , definition of national standards , equalization payments , international trade and interprovincial trade .

Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question . 
however , we hope that the issue will be thoroughly reviewed by the committees of the House and the Senate in the weeks to come .

he went on to cite a number of decisions that leave a great deal to be desired in their interpretation and application . 
what we are saying to the House is that we deserve a say . 
i know the government is afraid to start discussing these options because it has shown no leadership when it comes to vision , when it comes to how to make the country work better . 
that has been the complaint I have heard over and over again from my Quebec colleagues , many of whom feel there is no other option but to split from this country . 
all the Conservatives spoke of for nine years was about what terrible financial shape the country was in .

honourable senators , in reply to the question of Senator Roche , I will make two observations . 
if a drunk driver causes the death of another person , that drunk driver is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life . 
we remember what happened in election terms . 
everybody is starting to feel the pinch as their receivables escalate and skyrocket into numbers they have never seen before , with no end in sight . 
is it agreed , honourable senators ? 
who could claim , without raising an eyebrow , that this system is truly equitable , transparent and accessible , a system that allows corporations , which do not have the right to vote , to meddle in the electoral process by making contributions far beyond the capability of the ordinary voter , and thus unduly influencing the political policy of the parties and the candidates seeking votes ? 
it does not matter whom we are talking about . 
honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
i hope all members of the House agree that we must give very careful thought to the Department of Transport ' s procedure and , at the same time , to the importance of priority in achieving nuclear disarmament . 
that little wee problem happens to be the breadbasket of Canada . 
i want to progress and make a better future by learning from past mistakes . 
i am getting to the point . 
paired 
on this point I believe the member has a valid argument that perhaps a parliamentary committee should be struck to thoroughly investigate ways in which we can strengthen the protection that Canadians need in ensuring that their personal information remains just that , personal . 
on average , Quebec received about 14 % of the federal funding for R and D , and so far , nothing has changed . 
madam Speaker , I note from the supply day motion that the Progressive Conservatives have attempted to cover all of the hot button issues they think are facing Canada today . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
that gives some indication to the viewing public and those in the House and the gallery of the need for improving the legislation . 
before I move to the actual substance of the bill I would first like to ask a question . 
motion No. 388 negatived 
hon. Dan Hays ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) , with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 58 ( 1 ) ( a ) , moved : 
i resent that . 
i should like to make the answer as brief and direct as I can , but it may require more than a " yes " or a " no " . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
hon. John Buchanan : 
honourable senators , lest anyone confuse our geography with isolation or insularity , let me put your minds as rest . 
i might suggest that the bill could also mention citizenship , passports , pensions , creditor confidence , the Canadian dollar , international agreements , an access corridor if the province is in the centre of Canada , defence issues , military assets and a potential rejoining of Canada . 
some hon. members : 
therefore I would ask for the unanimous consent of the House to transfer all the Reform motions which are not in the name of the hon. member for North Vancouver or the hon. member for Elk Island to be moved by the hon. member for North Vancouver and seconded by the hon. member for Elk Island . 
happily , a provision of this sort is found in Bill C - 2 .

as Canadian citizens we are justly proud of our first place ranking in the United Nations human development index , but such classifications are meaningless for the individuals who struggle every day to find something to eat and do not know where they will be sleeping at night . 
we will point out , piece by piece , our concerns with this legislation because it is flawed and needs to be dealt with more thoroughly . 
honourable senators , I support the motion which is presently before us . 
since that time , there has been a dramatic 20 % drop in reservations with InterCanadian . 
examining more closely the vote itself in Confederation in 1867 , the British North America Act said that the control of the federal franchise , the vote , would remain a provincial matter until parliament decided otherwise . 
it has been very hard for me to sit in such close physical proximity to the Reform Party members and hear them and their outrageous comments for these past many months . 
i am asking the question to the current minister , since the Minister for International Trade does not want to answer for his actions . 
i think it would enlighten our colleagues opposite . 
i was hoping to speak to it earlier . 
Dr. Powell did the same in Toronto . 
in 1998 inflows to Canada were $ 22.9 billion , but Canadians invested a record $ 39.8 billion abroad . 
my guess is that the vast amount of that money will be spent on the ice storm . 
Mr. Speaker , I am very happy today to participate in the debate on Bill C - 4 .

there is no doubt that , as they said at the U.S. Democratic convention in 1968 , the whole world is watching . 
i am very patient , but there are limits .

i think that 4 % to 5 % is high .

Mr. Speaker , the hon. member who just asked the question and his party were one of a number of people and parties that asked us a year ago to do something to assist producers so that the precipitous drop in incomes in 1998 in comparison to previous years could be assisted . 
it seems to me that the member for Roberval and his colleagues are underestimating Quebecers , their intelligence and their vision of Canada and the world . 
the inhabitants of the beaches area have been deprived of this essential service because the water table has been contaminated for several years . 
senator Oliver : 
as for the financial resources earmarked by the governments of Canada and Quebec to fight organized crime , they seem clearly inadequate . 
the public will support it . 
in many ways , the motto of " Be Prepared , " which Baden - Powell himself noted was founded on his own initials and means that " you are always to be in a state of readiness in mind and body to do your duty , " has been a hallmark of this distinguished senator who I have always been so proud for so many years to call a true friend . 
yet , Amnesty International and others were pointing out that political opponents were being inappropriately jailed and not receiving fair trials and treatment .

this is a constant muddle . 
Mr. Speaker , I want to touch on a couple of issues surrounding this debate that I , and probably many of my constituents , find somewhat puzzling .

on that basis , I commend this idea to you , Mr. Speaker .

that came from the business community . 
the Speaker : 
oh , oh . 
otherwise , there could be a very great incentive to an accused person to offer a plea to criminal negligence or manslaughter , and a similar incentive to a crown attorney to accept it .

why does the hon. member not wake up , smell the coffee and understand what is happening on farms in western Canada ? 
they are asking why this message did not get through in terms of getting the extra $ 1.3 billion . 
yet , though our athletes and many of our fighting personnel wore the maple leaf with pride , it was not until 1964 that a veteran of World War I , Prime Minister Lester Pearson , took up the difficult task of persuading Canadians to formalize their private love affair with the red maple leaf in a new national flag .

that may be what it takes in order to save the family farm and make sure farmers do not have to sacrifice themselves until such time as we get the EU and the Americans in line on this .

Mr. Yvan Loubier : 
i do not think the government has thought a lot about these things . 
only 4,500 of those pardons concern sex offenders . 
the forestry and mining industries have suffered in British Columbia because of a lack of certainty that exists regarding resource ownership in the province . 
this happened in Montreal in the early 1990 s . 
how many millions will the economic uncertainty created by Lucien Bouchard cost Quebecers and Canadians ? 
i think it is very misguided to state that . 
a carrier created by merging Air Canada and Canadian Airlines would use up a large portion of the slots at Toronto ' s airport , particularly during peak hours . 
i think that puts $ 1 billion in perspective . 
when workers are denied EI premiums , small and medium size businesses suffer too . 
this is not to improve it but just to restore it and make up for the money that has not been spent on the highways over the last seven or eight years . 
this week , Senator Gauthier gave me information on the precise nature of Part VII. 
on June 8 , 1999 , the Minister of Justice said in her speech :

Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) : 
there are days that the debate generates more heat than light , so in that context I would like to at least offer some statistical information with respect to charge rates . 
this is not a debate . 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
i quote the brief on page 5 : 
more shortcomings of CSIS senior managers are being exposed with each passing day . 
i must confess that my attention was drawn to her citation from Sigmund Freud providing an explanation of sociopathic character disorder .

other statistics tell us that aboriginal people have the highest mortality rate in Canada , at birth , tragically enough , but also as young people . 
that is something to be taken up behind the curtains .

unlike the Group No. 1 motions which consisted exclusively of amendments of my Bloc colleague , Group No. 2 motions comprise amendments of a variety of members both from the government and the opposition .

in Holly ' s specific case , in the Canada opportunities strategy we brought in a system whereby single parents will get a $ 3,000 a year grant to go back to university . 
to all these members I say thank you . 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) :

Ms. Wendy Lill ( Dartmouth , NDP ) : 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne 
i would have felt even better if it had addressed certain areas of post - secondary education , which the government appears to have completely ignored , and areas that I believe are critical if we are to move forward with knowledge into the 21 st century and not slide backwards or , if we are lucky , simply tread water .

Mr. Speaker : 
the attitude has to change . 
honourable senators , as was said by colleagues on both sides during the emergency debate , the program is not working effectively and must be repaired . 
i am happy to announce today that the two bands which were allowed to fish up to October 31 have agreed to pull all of their traps and fully abide by a regulated fishery . 
the legal aspect will have to be looked at in greater detail in committee .

therefore the petition calls upon parliament to use the federal budget for the year 2000 to introduce a multi - year plan to improve the well - being of Canada ' s children . 
it also authorizes the seizure of goods used for gangs ' criminal activities . 
unfortunately , I have the impression that , for political reasons , the justice minister only wishes to show us that she is backing down , or that this is the Liberals ' balanced approach . 
it does not qualify under a proper definition of what an omnibus bill should contain because there is certainly more than one principle contained in this bill .

one government and a provincial government suggested they did not want to have it for the opportunity of saving money , as the federal government did when it took away its contribution to the GRIP . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Immigration . 
in a system of government based on the rule of law , the laws and regulations created pursuant to its authority to give structure to society have a far reaching and profound impact on the daily lives of citizens . 
for the record , it says that Saskatchewan remains significantly below the previous five year average and is expected to remain significantly below the previous five year average in the year 2000 . 
Canadians do not have a say through their elected representatives because the elected representatives do not insist on having their say . 
the member for Crowfoot , who is a long - standing member of the justice committee , has made many good proposals over the years in this place on this issue . 
it also fails to address the whole aspect of government advertising and the government using taxpayers ' funds to prop itself up and to provide money to its own coffers . 
above all my many experiences here , some of which I enjoyed and some of which I did not , I have learned to respect the members of the Senate of Canada , their work , their commitment to their country , and their recognition of their constitutional responsibilities . 
in 1966 the difference between unemployment in the highest and lowest months was 46 % . 
the system is nothing less than the next generation of the Canadarm , which would help assemble and maintain the space station once in orbit .

this legislation is in line with what is happening elsewhere in the country .

honourable senators , I should like to ask a question of the Honourable Senator Austin . 
i commit myself , as my social democratic predecessors have done before me , to work tirelessly to achieve these just and time honoured goals . 
however , the Senate proposes that the list of offences to be flagged be incorporated in the act . 
the fact is that we do not even have the proper resources allocated right now in order to protect the stock .

in the meantime , every domestic economy , including Canada ' s , is continually scrutinized by international investors and business people to a depth of detail never before possible .

we want tax cuts for those who contributed most to helping the federal government eliminate the deficit . 
that means three times that amount are needed to maintain that 4,500 figure . 
it has been a ride over bad roads too , but that is another issue . 
it is regrettable in the extreme the federal government did not have the foresight to at least take under serious advisement the urgings of the Mi ' kmaq leadership to anticipate the outcome of the decision .

but to suggest that because an auditor requested to come in by the Government of Canada has identified some problems in the files and that a cabinet minister needs to step aside over that is political hysteria .

instead , the parties involved know the limitations imposed and must work within such a framework to establish an agreement that satisfies not only the court ' s requirements but the objectives of each party .

however , we should have been back here September 1 , not the middle of October . 
the only thing the bill is very clear about is that the question could not envisage other possibilities in addition to the secession of the province from Canada , such as economic or political arrangements with Canada , that obscure a direct expression of the will of the population of that province on whether the province should cease to be part of Canada .

we are saying that not only is that a mistake , not only is that a huge error , but it is reprehensible and we cannot proceed in parliament until that is addressed .

when it comes to criminal justice , we have a vision of Canada as a safe society where people can live their lives , walk on the streets , drive on the highways , go to school , go to work , shop in the stores , visit the parks and live in their homes without fear of harm to themselves or their property or , even worse , fear of harm to their loved ones . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
we are looking for the government to do two principal things . 
in the past my party and I have not supported dedicated taxes . 
the legislation deals with all those issues . 
i believe everybody in the House is in agreement that this is an excellent initiative . 
however , it is unfortunate and even troubling to see that the minister and her government have chosen to ignore the advice of their own court of justice .

what was the motive of the government in all of this ? 
Dr. Bagshaw was the director of the first birth control clinic in Canada . 
canada ' s position is that our health care and public education system are not negotiable and will not be jeopardized in the current upcoming negotiations . 
i would take issue with what I have heard from Senator Kinsella , which is that we may have a lesser standard of behaviour in this place than in the other place . 
native leaders say that the federal government has a fiduciary responsibility to protect their interests and their rights , but in a treaty of collectivity , how are the rights of the individual going to be protected ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
we need to be very much on guard against the kind of fearmongering that has been generated toward many of those exploited and desperate people .

Mr. Speaker , last week when the minister of fisheries went to Halifax to try to negotiate a settlement for the crisis in the fishery , the minister could not get an agreement .

on May 25 , 1999 the committee tabled its report entitled " Toward Eliminating Impaired Driving " with an appended draft bill . 
that is interfering with the fair tendering process , yet there is case after case of this happening . 
the Minister of Human Resources Development and her officials do have discretionary power , and I see the member opposite shaking her head , but it is really a discretionary power even if , under the legislation , the minister has the authority to give grants or to fund programs , there is a highly discretionary component to all these things .

honourable senators , I wanted to ask a question of the Honourable Senator Carstairs and I was quietly waiting my turn , as I always do .

they are required to use the medical exemption which is an exemption designed for catastrophic health events in a person ' s life on an ongoing basis . 
after all , one cannot get something for nothing , and money spent on improving our colleges and universities , and providing financial incentives to pursue higher education , is indeed an investment . 
Mr. Speaker , I realize that my friend was not particularly enamoured with the fact that under section 47 the bureau was given an advisory role , but I think he will agree that the report which has come from the bureau in the last few days is a comprehensive one and certainly has helped us , helped me , in developing the guidelines which I brought before the committee on Wednesday of this week . 
the ability within the electronic distribution channels to bypass any or all of these traditional middlemen between producer and consumer raises serious issues for the collection of taxes , particularly withholding taxes .

this study will show us what we must do to help the RCMP fulfill its mandate , which is getting larger every day .

in October the Prime Minister shared his vision for the new millennium : a nation built on learning , innovation and excellence . 
we also deal with sending the message to those involved in people smuggling that if they want to make money smuggling people into Canada they are no longer going to be able to do it because , by gosh , Canada deals with these situations quickly , firmly and we act on the hearings while still respecting the UN convention on refugees . 
it is also declining in value and historical significance because of changes in forest composition after the first cut . 
all too often , especially with this government , it makes the claim that it is listening to the people only to turn around and do something exactly opposite to the will of the people . 
the first one concerns the procedure for drafting the question .

the new act will also prohibit the transfer of surplus funds from a party or local association to a candidate after polling day .

as they do not have to keep to a contribution limit , corporations may contribute huge sums to the federal political parties of their choice , and , need I point out , these contributions certainly do not go to political parties for purely philanthropic purposes .

i am also very surprised to see that federal Liberal members from Quebec are not interested in this issue and come to the House only to reiterate what has been said by the industry minister , who does not seem to care much about what is going on in Quebec in this area as in many others .

some people may ask right off the bat why that should be . 
in all honesty , my constituents will not be able to support such a bill once they know what it is all about .

if he does not have a copy as yet , I will deliver one to him at the earliest possible moment . 
instead everything is in limbo and subject to abuse . 
i also said I would work toward implementing the platform of the Liberal Party , an ambitious economic , social and cultural platform . 
that the House do now proceed to orders of the day . 
we have to somehow keep that as our primary focus in all of the remarks we make . 
it is not the finance minister nor the government that balanced the budget ; it was balanced on the backs of taxpayers . 
the Prime Minister , who says he wants to go down in history as the person who saved Canada , may well be remembered as the Prime Minister who ignored democracy in Canada and in Quebec . 
why is the government showing such blatant favouritism toward one of the proponents of the Onex merger ? 
the areas where federal or provincial law would prevail include environmental assessment and protection , public order , peace and safety , health services , social services , buildings and public works , traffic and transportation , solemnization of marriage , fish and wildlife sales and the regulation of intoxicants .

hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal 
in fact that is wrong , wrong , wrong . 
today in the interest of time and procedure , it is the disingenuous , disruptive spirit of this bill rather than its blatantly flawed details that I will address during the time I have been given . 
it was also during the days of the famous Diefenbaker - Pearson debates which became rather acrimonious at times and , as I understand , very heated . 
i recognize , as all of my colleagues do , that the federalist option is a legitimate one . 
people say that they just want everybody to be treated equally , in other words , treated the same .

now , we seldom sit on a Monday evening , but we still aim for a short Wednesday . 
how did it happen , however , that we found ourselves in the situation - in the case of Quebec - where only the representatives of the Liberal Party were in favour ? 
it gives me a great deal of pleasure to tell the people of Canada about the strength of the opposition in the House , because if it were not for the Bloc Quebecois - and I give them full marks - if it were not for the pressure of the Conservatives and also of the Reform Party , this kind of motion would never have come to the House . 
very clearly , we will support this bill . 
we cannot have a situation like occurred in Bosnia where soldiers helplessly watched while innocent citizens were gunned down .

instead of the minister coming along with his colleague , the minister of Indian affairs , both of them proud as punch , to inform us that everything is just fine , that there are no problems , that now there is a moratorium , that the people will talk to each other , he should hop a plane this very night with his colleague , go down there to sit down and define what is a reasonable livelihood . 
in an attempt to correct this longstanding problem , the witness protection program was created .

i will conclude by asking all members of this House to ensure that transfer payments are restored , to make sure that the provinces , which are responsible for the health care system , can meet the needs of all their clienteles , including the veterans , with new moneys .

Mr. Andr é Harvey 
it is the Gitanyow and the Gitxsan who are fighting for their rights .

his struggle , it has been noted , was the concern for the proper source of authority in religious belief under a totalitarian government determined to mould the beliefs of its citizens and extract public affirmations of loyalty . 
this is all Chinese to me . 
Mr. Speaker , I am surprised that , after the same question has already been answered ten times , it is still being asked . 
i am not opposed to people getting work if it is appropriate to them . 
that means that one in every one hundred children are born with these sometimes life - threatening defects making it the number one birth defect in Canada .

i am asking the parliamentary secretary and the Liberal government to reconsider because one of the five fundamental cornerstones is at risk . 
in his speech in reply to the Speech from the Throne he gave the government both the history and economic lessons as to who created Canada ' s financial crisis - the Trudeau Liberals - and who put in place a basis to resolve it - the Mulroney Conservatives . 
there is an old maritime expression that the fish stinks from the head . 
i think they would be quite surprised indeed to learn that the Reform Party somehow was their spokesperson .

senator Nolin has asked for a study that will last at least three years , without having a general work plan or a budget . 
to the Standing Committee on Finance 
the Speaker : 
we asked a question . 
democracy is expressed in different ways . 
my colleague from Mercier initially led the charge on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois . 
No. 
let us look at a specific example for our viewers , who are wondering what it all boils down to . 
historically the minister is very conservative in his estimates . 
one relies on one ' s Senate colleagues to read Hansard . 
this is not a diversionary tactic for my constituents . 
i would invite everyone to compare the NDP platform with what we have done here in Ottawa on behalf of farmers . 
madam Speaker , it strikes me has a bit odd that a bill dealing with the protection of personal information has already been put under gag order , as we are just beginning . 
he first said that the Federation of Canadian Municipalities was given a full briefing . 
the Minister of Finance has told Canadians of the tremendous surplus of close to $ 100 billion over five years .

how would he have voted had this been an issue before parliament ? 
Mr. Speaker , the Indian affairs minister has publicly stated that accountability is the top priority for his portfolio . 
it is the taxes that have been wrung out of individuals , to the tune of $ 6 billion from people making $ 20,000 a year or less , that have balanced the budget and reduced the deficit , not the Liberal government . 
senator Lewis has represented the best of the Senate in his quiet dignity , profound competence and hard work . 
honourable senators , I thank the minister for his reply . 
four out of four . 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
honourable senators , I wish to advise you of my grave concerns about Bill C - 4 which implements Canada ' s ratification of the international agreement creating the Civil International Space Station .

hon. Marie - P . 
on the day that last week ' s Throne Speech was delivered , the highway most travelled in one Newfoundland outport was the well - beaten path into gardens at the back of the community , gardens where men and women grow basic root crops in a way not much different from that of their ancestors in the early 19 th century , often working the very same patch of ground .

the ability for a people to set their own ways and determine their lives has made a big difference for everybody in the Yukon . 
i cannot see where there will be any independence . 
honourable senators , the Prime Minister has indicated that the aid budget will be increased . 
she was not given any chance even though the mistake was made in good faith and her hourly wage was indeed , say , $ 15 , as it is generally the case for nurses . 
madam Speaker , the only people who do not respect the intelligence and the rights of Quebecers are those who belong to the party sitting on the other side of the House and those who belong to the governing party in Quebec . 
having worked with a number of young offenders , it comes out that all these things put together creates a problem in society .

captain Riordon ' s wife , Sue Riordon , endured the double misery of watching her husband die a slow and agonizing death and hearing the government deny that he was suffering from anything but stress . 
CANADIAN FORCES 
i am looking at changing the Canadian tax regime . 
i want to bring to your attention , Mr. Speaker , that in these statutes , believe it or not , we still refer to our children as illegitimate . 
for example , Canada Post employees who deliver the mail deliver pamphlets . 
that says much about the strength of their relationship . 
it is simply that when we give people independence , when we give people the right to make their own choices about their future , we also give them the right to make mistakes , and that is democracy . 
one of them , of course , was the hepatitis C issue , which the government completely mishandled . 
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition from about 200 Canadians from all parts of the country on the issue of child poverty and the resolution of the House in November 1989 . 
the task force proposed a major transformation in our approach to health research and recommended the creation of the CIHR . 
a department survey of 300 band councils found that the most common problem was lack of control and conflict of interest . 
the law should specifically state that Ms. Anderson had the right to know whether or not that person had a communicable disease .

thus , justice would truly serve the people , and not a government which wants to buy votes at the expense of public safety in Quebec and Canada .

the Speaker : 
as a police officer I stuck my neck out way beyond probably where it should have been to do the very same thing that the member for Wild Rose spoke of because all of a sudden the charter , a wonderful charter , protects those who are being abusers . 
to begin with , the term " money bill " is not particularly helpful in the constitutional parliamentary life of Canada . 
we know that we have among us a truly respected Canadian in Senator John B . Stewart , who can legitimately join the pantheon of such senatorial giants as the Honourables Eugene Forsey , Raoul Dandurand , Muriel McQueen Fergusson , Cairine Wilson , Chubby Power , Duff Roblin and Arthur Meighen .

extended parental leave options could help to achieve these objectives . 
i know it must be difficult after lunch to have so many members in the Chamber trying to stay awake to listen to my presentation . 
there are some very serious implications . 
one can only hope that this measure would dramatically reduce the number of polls that are perhaps based on inaccurate or inadequate data . 
Mr. Speaker , the minister can explain it however she wants but the reality is that the review , the audit , said that things were not being done properly . 
the problem that confronts the government leadership in this house is that the Senate might very well be put in an impossible position or situation - on the one hand , an early deadline , and , on the other hand , an insistence that three particular officials be heard . 
the RCMP reports that there are biker gang activities and criminal enterprises in several parts of this country . 
Mr. Beno î t Sauvageau : 
these conversations and these meetings continue to go on . 
like the Pacific scandal , it too involved political contributions . 
all those opposed will please say nay . 
the question needs to be asked . 
some hon. members : 
on November 9 , 1998 , members of the Nisga ' a Nation ratified the final agreement through a ratification vote and on April 22 , 1999 , British Columbia passed the legislation it introduced to ratify the agreement . 
" ( 2 ) Clerical errors that occur in the framing or copying of any instrument drawn by an officer or an employee of the Nisga ' a government shall not be construed as invalidating that instrument , but when discovered they may be corrected under the authority of the Nisga ' a government . " 
it seems fairly easy to unanimously oppose something , someone or some bill .

honourable senators , certainly we will reflect on that suggestion . 
we know that the Prime Minister has always been prepared to manipulate the process , to use a provocative , powerful approach when he has a majority government to beat other provinces over the head . 
we are also examining the question of hours at this time . 
i declare Motion No. 150 lost . 
the throne speech made no mention of that issue whatsoever and yet it is an issue that has been brought forward on many occasions and presented to the federal government as a very pressing concern for those living in coastal areas .

honourable senators , I will attempt to confirm for the honourable senator whether there is any present intention to introduce legislation . 
it goes into the whole idea of tax sharing and tax agreements . 
in so moving , I wish to quote the Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau , who said at the ceremony to proclaim the Constitution on April 17 , 1982 : 
members 
when voting took place on Motion No. 356 , I believe it was , and the Table is trying to confirm it for me , the Speaker did not acknowledge voters subsequent to my colleague who did not initially stand .

( the House divided on Motion No. 38 , which was negatived on the following division ) : 
i am going to give a response which might surprise the hon. member , but my answer is indicative of a healthy democracy and the ability of members in the House to speak their minds and speak on behalf of their constituents and the people of Canada . 
on conflict of interest , there is no provision in this bill to ensure that people who are appointed to the board have no pecuniary or proprietary interests in the pharmaceutical industry or the medical devices industry . 
Mr. Keith Martin 
for the Minister of Justice to infer otherwise is ridiculous and certainly not worthy of further comment by this member . 
i point out to the speaker that the supreme court in this country comes under the Supreme Court of Canada Act . The supreme court comes under this parliament . 
would anyone describe the system as fair ? 
points OF ORDER 
unparliamentary words may be brought to the attention of the House either by the Speaker or by any Member . 
in terms of the Senator Di Nino ' s concern as to which committee this should be referred , I have asked for some information on the practice .

in fact it travelled to different parts of the country to seek the views of farmers and of people involved in the cultural industries . 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to talk to the bill about a code of conduct and whether an official code of conduct is a good idea here in the House of Commons and for parliamentarians generally .

to accuse the government of making that decision is just - 
there is an obvious attempt to deflect attention away from that , to somehow create an illusion that another issue will come on the agenda and perhaps bury the issue of the mismanagement that has taken place in Human Resources Development Canada , mismanagement that is perhaps systemic in many government departments .

madam Speaker , I am pleased to enter the debate on Bill C - 13 , an act to establish the Canadian institutes of health research and to repeal the Medical Research Council Act . 
of course , there will eventually be some degree of harmonization , but in the meantime , it may very well be that consumers will not enjoy the same protection as they did before . 
when garbage is taken away from our front steps and put in a landfill , it is the responsibility of the municipality . 
for instance , buying back licences , something that is often done , so that more space can be made for the aboriginal fishers who have had the supreme court rule in their favour . 
the impact of the Marshall case likely will not be confined to fish and it likely will not be confined to Atlantic Canada . 
the Speaker : 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
if it will affect virtually everyone and our tax dollars are involved , our operations are involved and the local government is involved as well , why would he refuse a referendum ?

a skilled workforce and a capacity to innovate continuously are crucial building blocks of a successful 21 st century economy . 
honourable senators , fortunately this particular event seems to be an isolated incident .

honourable senators , I am absolutely in order , and if anyone has an objection to what I am saying , they must rise on their feet and raise a point of order on what I am saying . 
i leave that with the government as a suggestion . 
the next question is on Motion No. 34 . 
does the finance minister plan to establish any limits , or does he intend to sign a blank cheque on behalf of Canadian taxpayers ? 
that Bill C - 9 be amended by adding after line 29 on page 7 the following new clause : 
that is what Reformers do not believe in because not one of them voted for equality even in the Canadian Human Rights Act .

i want to start off by talking about the provincial co - operation that needs to go on whenever we put any kind of legislation forward . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
Mr. Speaker , it has often been said that small business has been the engine that drives our economy . 
this is different from the amending process under the Constitution , which requires a resolution of both Houses , although the resolution in this house , if not given , is effectively suspensive for 180 days . 
i must put the question first and then see if more than five members rise . 
the only thing in the country that is dropping faster than personal income taxes is Reform ' s share of the popular vote . 
the Deputy Speaker :

i do not know the total number of jobs created , but I would be more than happy to obtain that information because I know the honourable senator will want me to share that information with all those in this place . 
we would like to comment on that process . 
that Bill C - 8 be amended by deleting Clause 14 . 
what kind of government do we have ? 
we must remember that the NPT , which was indefinitely extended in 1995 , legally obliges its signatories to negotiate the elimination of nuclear weapons , not merely their reduction . 
in fact , Canada has often been asked to assist third world countries to supervise and report on elections to ensure that the presiding government operates in a free , fair and open manner .

Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Kootenay - Columbia . 
all of us at some point in our electoral past , in volunteering in campaigns and our involvement in the election process , have delivered flyers door to door . 
i would like to ask him whether it is not a bit illogical to allow this offer , this debate among shareholders , to take place under a certain number of rules , while telling them that they could be changed . 
Mr. Speaker , if we had a blank cheque sitting here today , or if we had direct access to the treasury , what are some of the constructive thoughts and initiatives the member thinks the House should explore on behalf of her constituents ? 
someone should remind him though that , unlike his shopping list , the surplus is projected and expected , not confirmed , meaning that tax relief is doomed again . 
i take it as a point of immense national pride that , collectively , we have accepted that fundamental principle . 
but as I said earlier , chances are that the minister will choose not to be so accountable to parliament and hide behind the fact that we are dealing with a crown corporation .

does the Prime Minister still persist today in claiming that the scandalous mismanagement at HRDC is limited to these 37 cases ? 
Mr. Joe McGuire : 
i will give the honourable leader one example and ask him to carry it to the cabinet . 
many existing statutes and regulations often specify that information must be given in writing or certain documents must be signed . 
in fact , when Bernie ran for the leadership of our party in Nova Scotia , one of my sons was his campaign manager . 
if honourable senators will refer again to Beauchesne ' s , they will find that the word " misleading " as mentioned in paragraph 489 has been ruled unparliamentary on many occasions under the following headings : attempted to misrepresent , deliberately misled , deliberately misleading , misled and misleading the public . 
in so doing , they have had the support of their partners and many of the men who sit here today as their colleagues in both houses .

the real concern is that there should be rules in place in the Municipal Grants Act to ensure that neither party can arbitrarily alter the terms and conditions of the relationship by simply backing out , as we saw in 1992 . 
another reason is that aboriginal shelter issues received government attention much later than the needs of other parts of Canadian society . 
i strongly voice my concern too . 
there are obvious legal problems . 
regional support was broken down as follows : in my province of Ontario , 66 % of Canadians were in support ; in B.C. support was at 68 % ; and in Atlantic Canada support was at a high of 75 % .

this is more a point of information , but I had assumed , during the two days of debate on this issue , that the report would be presented here and that the Senate on its own would decide what to do with it . 
honourable senators , may I ask a question ? 
i can assure you that , for the moment , we are absolutely confident of arriving together with a strong voice in Seattle in order to protect and promote the interests of all Canadians . 
i sincerely hope that the government will at least open this up to proper debate and allow us to speak on this instead of keeping us to 10 minutes and shutting off debate with no questions and answers in the House .

in the legislation ' s absence , there would be no limitation on the government ' s prerogative to undertake negotiations on the secession of a province other than the confidence of the House of Commons , but that existing limitation or constraint that can be exercised at any time by the House of Commons is a very important one .

second Reading - Debate Continued 
senator Boudreau : 
it is interesting how some things never change in the country . 
if the vast majority of Quebecers support separation , if there is a broad consensus , then I would recognize it , but not at 50 % plus one . 
is that really your position ? 
i report to them , hear their feedback and offer any assistance I can so that they might understand the programs of government and what the priorities are at the federal level . 
honourable senators , I wish to congratulate the chair of the committee , Senator Bacon , for the way in which she conducted both our public hearings and the sessions spent in drafting this report . 
for them , knowing that the offender will never walk the streets again as a free person will bring a sense of relief and an element of closure to a sad chapter in their lives . 
honourable senators , the Deputy Leader of the Government has tried to clarify the situation this afternoon , but Senator Corbin , by his intervention , has indicated that we have a problem now because that first committee will be required under our rules to submit its report as soon as it is ready . 
the first category is clarification of the purpose of the act . 
a significant number of agreements between France and Quebec have been signed under this framework . 
are the minister and the government aware that this incident could seriously damage the credibility of the Canadian secret service ? 
the question is on Motion No. 1 . 
this is not fair . 
if the truth be known , I do not think we have to look much further than this bill to begin to see why .

these are the countries whose diplomatic policies have the greatest impact on Canada . 
Mr. Speaker , it hurts me to say this but I would like to compliment my two Liberal colleagues on their speeches . 
fisheries leaders have worked with native chiefs to find a way to recognize native treaty rights . 
i believe we have an opportunity here , as senators , to do something positive . 
in the interim until that happens , because it will not happen overnight and will probably take years , I would suggest to the parliamentary secretary that he stand with us and with the farmers . 
the Speaker :

moreover , these institutes will be virtual , since they will allow researchers in universities , hospitals and other research centres in Canada , as well as university students , to communicate with each other and to share information electronically . 
this bill would open up those records or allow access to those records so that those who are hiring people or bringing on volunteers or putting people in place to care for children can perform thorough checks . 
can we imagine calling for those kinds of cutbacks and now arguing the other side ?

the same goes for secretaries and all other occupational groups .

these children are armed with guns that are light enough for an eight - year - old to carry and shoot , or with machetes sharp enough to slice off arms and legs . 
it is useless to dwell on what might have been , but surely we can try to move forward instead of reinforcing the same old mistakes . 
that the debate be now adjourned . 
i am definitely not a sovereignist ; I am definitely not a Liberal . 
that is an important bit of advice to heed at this time . 
the honourable senator says the Nisga ' a will not go to arbitration . 
yes , there is a lot of tedium to it , but at this particular time of year , as Senator Murray will know , many things must come together so the government can get its supply by March 31 . 
that Bill C - 9 be amended by adding after line 29 on page 7 the following new clause : 
can the parliamentary secretary answer how he is going to continue to defend those types of attacks and persecution of our farmers ? 
if so , when can we expect to see some activity on this file ? 
again , I just point out that from our point of view these grants and contributions are extraordinarily important .

yet , when we examine the Speech from the Throne , supposedly the speech laying out the legislative program of the federal government which claims it lies awake nights trying to figure out how to make this federation work better , there is no recognition of this regional fact at all , no new principles or visions that respond to the new wind that is blowing out of Atlantic Canada . 
i stress intent of the bill because certainly as a private member ' s item it is quite difficult for an individual bill to be as comprehensive as say , for instance , the special joint Commons - Senate committee on custody and access . 
every single action I have seen in the House , every single example that is used by the Reform Party when it comes to aboriginal people , has been negative , has been allegations of what it perceives to be corruption , and has been divisive .

if Air Canada came forward with a proposal which violated the 10 % rule , my take on that would be that it would be saying that it does not meet the requirements of the law of the land now , but it would respectfully submit that there is a proposal on the floor which now exceeds the rule and it would like its proposal to be considered as well .
