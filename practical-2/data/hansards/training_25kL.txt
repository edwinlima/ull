Mr. Speaker , in order to allow Telefilm Canada to regain its credibility , what it the Minister of Canadian Heritage waiting for to ask the auditor general to shed light on a case where the actions of a minority are detrimental to the whole television industry ? 
hon. Herb Gray 
i would like to see democracy reflected in bills such as Bill C - 10 but it is not reflected . 
we already know that the legislation will have to be changed or amended accordingly . 
in the last eight years there has been an amazing erosion of legislative support for traditional marriage , and this in spite of the fact that there is overwhelming evidence showing the benefits of traditional marriage to children , adults and society . 
Mr. Speaker , I know the farmers in the affected areas will be pleased with the announcement the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food made in the House today . 
in this case , there are only 13 , so we should be able to go through them fairly quickly . 
Mr. Speaker , first , I would like to thank the hon. member for the way in which he mesmerized his colleagues on this occasion . 
( official Version ) 
it is clear that this matter has received a lot of thought from a lot of Canadians . 
however , if a particular standing committee , such as the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry or another committee , wants to examine the estimates for the Department of Agriculture or whatever , there is no problem .

new Democrats were very strong on making this amendment and we are hoping the government will support this aspect of the bill . 
i think it is a sad state of affairs when senators themselves do not even have confidence in the work they do to hold up their institution to public attention .

Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Friday , just as her parliamentary secretary was telling the House that , in the case of the audiovisual production affair , the RCMP must be allowed to do its job without any interference , the Minister of Canadian Heritage was saying outside the House that a major administrative investigation had been launched into Telefilm Canada and production tax credits , as the Bloc Quebecois has been demanding since the beginning of this affair .

Mr. Speaker , it is a long question and much to cover . 
they routinely occur in many parts of the world today . 
so far he has been extremely evasive about specifying the formula for compensation based on fair market value and lost investment revenue .

miss Deborah Grey 
in 1993 Canadians were suffering under a bloated and arrogant government , one devoid of any new ideas and fundamentally out of touch with the electorate . 
Eurasia and North America are just 50 miles apart at this point and almost touch each other like two fingers reaching out . 
this is a definite loophole , one which I fear the governing party would exploit to its own unfair advantage . 
Mr. Gilles - A . 
these motions basically mean that private groups must disclose , without consent , personal information on citizens to government and law enforcement agencies when they are requested to do so for investigative purposes in the interest of national security . 
surely there is no one here who is proud of the old treaty system or how it was arrived at , if we study how those treaties were arrived at .

Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold 
did the impossibility of serving the Senate and aspiring for a place in the House of Commons place him in a conflict role and cause confusion ? 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member ' s riding is receiving money .

we see opportunities for Canadians to participate in exporting our cultural products and with them our values and our sense of what we are about ourselves . 
i hope that you , Mr. Speaker , and every member of the House will plan on going to see this very important exhibit . 
that Bill C - 9 , in Clause 27 , be amended by replacing line 6 on page 10 with the following : 
probably members of parliament , more than most people , need counselling and help in coping with everyday life . 
again , this , in my opinion , is the thrust of the debate .

more people were killed in that war than in all of the wars in the Middle East since the beginning of the century , all over a few miles of sand .

senator Austin : 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the measures concerning third parties are based on three major principles . 
my friend knows that the co - op to which Senator Buchanan referred is seeking only to get one of those assets , namely the Donkin property . 
as I said , the Bloc Quebecois supports the bill before us today , despite the fact it lacks clear direction and does not provide for consultations with the provinces and various stakeholders . 
we are not in that situation as we have seen by going to the supreme court on the Marshall decision . 
on a systemic level , governance is an important contributing factor to a properly performing market and investment system which , in turn , has an important impact on the wealth creation process in the Canadian economy as a whole . 
points OF ORDER 
unfortunately , I did not hear the earlier presentation of the petition , but I did hear what Senator Kinsella just said . 
this cost has to be tallied in the houses of government by the democratically elected people who make these decisions . 
each time this occurs it makes me proud . 
as a matter of fact , I remember my old Liberal friend , who was not long ago the premier of Nova Scotia , describe the situation in Cape Breton as an economic crisis . 
the only official language of the parliament of the time was English . 
concerns on the siting and size parameters necessary to protect and conserve marine biological diversity in national marine conservation areas remain unanswered . 
that in my mind reflects on a very specific wish to make the question somewhat cloudy . 
Mr. Derrek Konrad 
yeas 
as a matter of fact your visit is quite timely because I have a story to tell you '' . 
we are grown up enough in the country to stop the practice of the Prime Minister toying around with the electorate for the clear advantage of the ruling party by requiring in the future that byelections be held within six months of vacancies arising in the House . 
that Bill C - 9 , in Clause 7 , be amended by replacing lines 41 and 42 on page 3 with the following : 
Mr. Speaker , I am not trying to hide anything . 
that funding is in addition to the $ 1 billion the federal and provincial governments contribute each year to the safety net programs , including crop insurance and the net income stabilization account which cushion farmers during difficult times , and those programs which invest in marketing research and other initiatives which serve to strengthen the sector . 
i have said time and time again that members should read all of the Nisga ' a final agreement . 
i suppose the first question to be asked is exactly what does the Canadian tourism commission do and why does it need to be a crown corporation . 
adjournment 
Mr. Speaker , following the introduction by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs of a bill denying the fundamental rights of Quebecers , I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to table this document , which will no doubt enlighten it . 
we lived in a small university apartment on the Halifax waterfront , with no telephone because we could not afford one . 
motion No. 150 negatived 
Mr. Inky Mark 
does the member agree with the government when it makes those statements ? 
i will now put the motions in Group No. 2 to the House . 
after slashing transfers to the provinces for post - secondary education , the current government has taken some baby steps to make it up in small part to Canadian students . 
as I said before , they were the words of a Mr. Rean Meyer , President of the Heraldry Society of Canada , British Columbia Yukon Branch . 
it has to recognize and respond to the rapid rate of change . 
that display of heroism in the face of this unexpected tragedy reminds us of the good in each of us . 
this problem is not isolated to this particular case . 
Mr. Andr é Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 397 , an act to change the name of the electoral district of Chicoutimi . 
this will put more guns , illegal and otherwise , on the black market . 
parenting education programs are not new but classes tailored to the specific needs of divorcing families are a relevant recent phenomenon in Canada and the U.S. 
let them feed their families . 
it is clear and quite simple . 
i have witnessed first hand the pain , discouragement and financial suffering of victims of hepatitis C in my riding . 
the Prime Minister is clearly unaware of the impressions and the questions he is generating among taxpayers because of the HRD billion dollar bungle . 
what I also said was that the Indian Act is silent on women ' s rights and it is an issue we will be dealing with . 
how can we get the message to people in the cities to recognize this problem and assist us in the solution ? 
how about Bill C - 110 ? 
honourable senators , I have the honour to table , in both official languages , the report of the 29 th annual meeting of the Canadian group of the Canada - France Inter - Parliamentary Association , held from September 8 to September 15 , 1999 in Montreal , Laval , Ottawa , Vancouver and Victoria . 
the hon. Minister of Human Resources Development . 
the hon. member for Okanagan - Shuswap on a point of order . 
honourable senators , I also question the need for Bill C - 247 , given the changes to the Criminal Code in 1996 regarding high - risk offenders . 
but how does he explain that it kept no tabs at all on a $ 500,000 grant to Wal - Mart for several months ? 
yet , absolutely unbelievable cuts were made to transfers to the provinces for health care . 
No. 
that did not come from the Reform Party . 
Mr. Speaker , that question is totally strange , because , as I said , we worked with GM to save jobs at Boisbriand . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 408 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
Mr. Speaker , that would be a great new story again except for the fact that according to the terms and conditions she cannot delegate that authority . 
the important thing to remember here is the maxim of the wisest of common law legal philosophers , Jeremy Bentham . 
who should be saved , the baby or the mother ? 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to rise in the House today to speak about people , plants and pride , the slogan of Communities in Bloom , an organization which seeks to provide a national focus for established provincial and community based beautification programs across Canada . 
honourable senators , I thank the honourable senator for the question . 
it would be a lot less expensive , a lot less costly to elect the nine supreme court justices and to ask them , as they have the monopoly of truth , to legislate as they see fit , which might not always be how the people really want it . 
that left 16 days for a company , an investor , a group of investors or consortiums to come up with a package involving $ 6 billion . 
to ram through the Nisga ' a treaty in Parliament may be to unravel the Supreme Court of Canada initiative undertaken by the federal government in the case of Quebec secession . 
we have heard in the media and in the House about the projects that have been approved across the country , how they have benefited the various ridings . 
while I raise these concerns about the current drafting of the bill , I want to emphasize that New Democrats will go into the committee stage with open minds . 
her presence here today tells us how far we have come as a nation . 
objections to this bill will come from those who fear that it is but the thin edge of the wedge which in time will lead to the end of the ceremonial as we know it today . 
motion No. 117 negatived 
i met the government negotiators in this particular case and I was impressed by their dedication , their hard work and their open mindedness . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not know what memo the member is referring to . 
a member of the opposition says there is too much bureaucracy . 
the problem with this is that it has given some people the false sense that all first nations are poorly managed , when in fact many first nations manage themselves extremely well . 
Canadians are justifiably proud of having built communities where citizens feel safe . 
they are asking if they will be able to fish next spring . 
to conclude my comments today , Bill C - 9 does nothing to repair the damage caused by the 100 plus years of the reserve system . 
it did not protect northern regions . 
it is part of the constitution . 
Mr. Gordon Earle : 
volume 138 , Issue 15 
we had to deal first with a $ 42 billion deficit . 
i would ask the hon. member for Langley - Abbotsford , in respect for the House , to wear his jacket . 
i do not feel that the Liberal government supports tourist operators , especially those who are small business owners and employees . 
members 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron : 
Mr. John Cannis : 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
i listened with much interest to the speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice - I find it all odd that the minister did not come to the House to defend the bill herself at second reading , instead of her parliamentary secretary - but I think he has failed to grasp the problem . 
it puts into practice the values of Canadians from coast to coast to coast . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for her question . 
they have the legal right to get married and to raise children . 
budget SURPLUS 
some hon. members : 
and it is the president of the Chambre des notaires who is speaking . 
some members suggested we might look at that together . 
why is the Prime Minister stoking the fires of separatism ? 
how does this hurt Canadian families , Canadian entrepreneurs and Canadian investors ? 
powers of clemency rightfully belong with the clemency granting agencies . 
they knew who was the Prime Minister . 
just wait on Bill C - 9 . 
the Government of Canada has the mandate under the constitution to enter into treaties of this nature . 
while there can be levels of services , common initiatives and exchanges in that area , there is no need for a superstructure such as the Canadian tourism commission , which will get involved in jurisdictions where Quebec is already very active . 
petitioners from the Grand Bend , Lucan and Strathroy areas have signed the said petition . 
some would like not to be held accountable , but our whole system of parliamentary democracy is based upon the principle of ministerial accountability . 
in the meantime we are working on a process that will accommodate both commercial and native fisheries for years to come . 
in the particular case of the Nisga ' a agreement , we have a form of government that is apart from all other governments . 
DEVCO 
i am truly saddened that the minister has chosen to ignore the needs of our farm communities . 
national UNITY 
we have this crisis in agriculture . 
however , in a case like this one where the minister ' s practices are in question an ethics committee would be a logical tool in establishing the realities of the situation .

canada ' s post - secondary institutions have been struggling to do more and more with less and less . 
the Honourable Gildas L . Molgat , Speaker 
her appeals to the military were met with scepticism . 
members 
it concerns whether the situation to which I refer creates a conflict of interest . 
later on that year , when faced with miners who wanted to open Donkin mine , who wanted some kind of assurance from the government as to a plan for Devco , the former member of parliament for Cape Breton - East Richmond said , " There are no rabbits in the hat , boys . 
* * * 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
this bill is almost racist . 
the Speaker : 
they certainly deserve protection and they have received it . 
i think the government was right in putting it to a legislative committee , because clearly there was no other standing committee that could possibly have the jurisdiction over a question like this . 
introduction and first reading 
we believe that passing legislation to ensure swift implementation of the new provisions will save lives . 
members 
that is why our programs are focused on working with Canadians to ensure that . 
they reflect the fact that we have allowed the capability of our forces to decline to the point where longer - term effectiveness has been put in jeopardy . 
Mr. John Nunziata 
this is one clear indication of our commitment to try to promote democratic reform in that country . 
we will provide them with career information and access to work experience and learning . 
however , the past has taught us , all too well , the pressing need for such legislation .

i am referring to caring , compassionate individuals who unselfishly donate their time , their energy , their skills and often financial support to support worthy community endeavours . 
they are well taken . 
however , it is a quasi judicial , independent body and we will not interfere with its process . 
i have no agreement to entertain the motion to defer until tomorrow .

hon. David M. Collenette : 
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) :

it is time to act , because Canada is becoming increasingly globalized internationally .

i have many things that I would like to say about first nations , not the least of which is that the government has an undemocratic approach to anything to do with first nations . 
when we have in a government a culture of gross mismanagement which is ignored , which is then covered up , which is then denied and minimized , then there is something very wrong in the whole administration of the government . 
i am not sure I have the numbers right but if my memory serves me correctly , I believe that in total the Liberal government had in the 1997 election a spending limit of around $ 30 million . 
i know that his department is very active there , but could the secretary of state tell us about some of the things his office is doing in the great province of Saskatchewan ? 
when I became a member of the House I never imagined for a moment that one day I would be reproached for caring too much about the fundamental component of democracy . 
in fact she was spending about $ 4,000 a month participating in these various fundraising efforts , all for various kinds of prizes . 
the amount of money that will actually come out of the system from Ottawa to Nova Scotia and the other provinces in the Atlantic region is not even as much money as these provinces received last year . 
if the member for Wentworth - Burlington would dig into the short path , he would clearly see that there have been hidden agendas in other bills that have come before the House . 
i am thinking of Montreal , for example , and cities like Toulouse , where the aeronautical and chemical industries played a key role in the city ' s development , or Boston , with its technological institute .

it is up to the older generations of our society to encourage the newer generations to remember . 
if he was up to date , he would know that he was wrong about the Reform Party policy .

i believe that the fact of having to publish the full rationality behind polls conducted will prevent , obviously , in the context of a regular election campaign , the publication of certain polls intended strictly to serve partisan purposes and to manipulate the very democratic action people are called on to take from time to time , namely vote in all good conscience . 
i want to say to all Canadians , especially our youth as we move into the 21 st century , we must never forget . 
the court held that the statement of claim was valid as it related to the issue of the two governments making it impossible to bargain in good faith because they had already reached agreement with the Nisga ' a . 
as we do this , the government remains committed , as opposed to the opposition party , to upholding the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ; not just for some , but for all . 
the new regime will apply to both domestic and international carriage of passengers by ship and , accordingly , will finally bring Canadian law in this field into line with that of most of our trading partners . 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :

it would be clear to anyone who closely examines it that the Nisga ' a treaty works within the current framework of the Canadian constitution .

this is a concrete measure that the government and parliamentarians will have to adopt some day if they are serious about learning from the past . 
it is the acts of violence that strike fear in the hearts of the elderly and the children who endure the harassment and brutality of a generation held unaccountable for its actions . 
clearly , when someone breaks the law and commits a heinous crime , it has to be dealt with swiftly , in a meaningful way as stated in the act and in some cases severely . 
the governor in council is the cabinet . 
Mr. Derek Lee 
Mr. Speaker , I want to assure the member and all members in the House that voting is a fundamental right of our democracy . 
the only country is Canada , the best place in the world in which to live , for everybody except farmers . 
a lot of that is coming right out of the pockets of farmers .

motion No. 61 
then , when the travel agents ' association wanted to meet with the airlines to discuss the rate structure , it was threatened with anti - competition charges under the Competition Act by the very same airline . 
why does the minister not just give Andy his Christmas bonus instead of the Christmas goose ? 
similarly the task of addressing the problem of youth crime requires a clear sense of purpose and values and the capacity to respond to the individual situations of each youth and his place in the community . 
again , I wonder if there is some way of augmenting this marriage counselling undertaking to give it more impact and force when children are involved . 
moreover , tax conventions contribute to the fairness of the tax system by ensuring that Canadians are not subject to double taxation , a situation that may arise when a taxpayer lives in a country but earns an income in another country . 
why are they not guaranteed seats on the board of directors of the Royal Bank of Canada , for example ? 
the taking of bodily substances always raises significant constitutional issues . 
Mr. Speaker , if the government would listen to Reform today , farmers would have the support they need . 
this event is put forth to recognize the importance of our children . 
my job is to build a strong foundation of administration to support the grants and contributions that are so valuable to Canadians . 
on motion of Senator Hervieux - Payette , report placed on the Orders of the Day for consideration at the next sitting of the Senate . 
Mr. Speaker , I believe you would find consent to apply the results of the vote just taken to Motions Nos. 18 , 19 and 21 . 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
that Bill C - 9 , in Clause 13 , be amended by replacing lines 9 and 10 on page 5 with the following : 
tens of millions of dollars in fuel taxes that could be used to upgrade our system stay in the United States , together with the costs of lodging , meals , repairs and incidentals . 
in fact , if we follow the argument advanced by Senator Fraser last Thursday to its logical conclusion , we will have a two - tier legislative system in Parliament . 
it was our party that advised the minister to negotiate with all stakeholders and introduce an implementation plan with conservation as the first priority . 
for Quebec , this arrangement comprises essentially a transfer of management to the Soci é t é d ' habitation du Qu é bec for all social housing funded by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation . 
i am surprised that the he is coming so close to the previous hon. member who spoke . 
some hon. members : 
what the Reform Party is saying right here and now is that it wants more federal intervention and more federal money for the provinces . 
our concern is that it is very loosely worded and not clearly prescribed in the legislation . 
i know how important intellectual properties are . 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
we have every intention of keeping our promise to the Nisga ' a people , to the mayor of Terrace and to the politicians in that region who support it . 
she is pursuing her studies in political science at the Faculty of Public Affairs and Management at Carleton University . 
the SENATE 
that the government should take action to remedy its overzealous and irresponsible pursuit of greater trade liberalization , which has caused extreme hardship for Canadian farmers - 
we have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in that committee to work on that study on our behalf - and I want all honourable senators to know that . 
port OF VANCOUVER 
i won ' t sit down . 
if the minister asks me what is the value of this rule , my response would be that he should tell me what is the cost of the 10 % rule to the airlines and therefore to their consumers . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
seasons greetings to CF members , their families and Canadians everywhere . 
the government talks frequently about the infrastructure program . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
animal Protection Legislation 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien ( Frontenac - M é gantic , BQ ) : 
it drives prices up . 
it is clearly a situation where it is parliament restraining the power of future governments . 
hon. David M. Collenette 
the Leader of the Government in the Senate will know the consequences of such a decision or position . 
members 
more than likely Ronald Reagan ' s is no longer busy now , so it is taking up some Reform and getting into that type of business . 
Ms. Diane St - Jacques 
i would suggest that most of the time it will be government that is actually in violation of its own act , in violation of its own laws . 
i sincerely hope that this issue will be examined in depth at committee . 
i hate to interrupt but I want to point out something for the record before we start debate on the motion . 
another challenge relates to the creation of new rules . 
canada ELECTIONS ACT 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien 
i ask a question and I do not prejudge the outcome but everyone can draw their own conclusions . 
it would give us a mark in the world as being on the leading edge of needed health care research . 
i do not think it is a question of " blurring the line " . 
that should a division be deferred until 5:30 p.m. today , the Speaker shall interrupt the proceedings at 3:30 p.m. to suspend the sitting until 5:30 p.m. for the taking of the deferred division ; and 
i urge all my colleagues who have industrious self - employed workers in their ridings wanting to take part in the democratic process to allow them to do so by voting for this amendment . 
the other issue which is directly tied to health research is the brain drain . 
honourable senators , I thank the honourable senator for the question and I appreciate the support that she has for the program . 
Mr. Speaker , I wonder if you and Mr. Lalonde sat in the House at the same time . 
motion No. 5 negatived 
the Speaker : 
this announcement immediately raised howls of protest and despair from Cape Breton as mining is all many Cape Bretoners have ever known . 
consequently , I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to table this document . 
No. 
the Deputy Speaker : 
he vowed to fight his own government tooth and nail on this bill . 
it very simply states that it " requires the judicial record of the conviction to be kept separate and apart from other criminal records '' . 
Mr. Ken Epp 
there is a litany of problems in this regard . 
hon. Senators : 
we are simply respecting the supreme court ruling . 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 396 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act ( donors to food banks ) . 
it would have a board that would be co - chaired by the federal minister , along with the provincial and territorial ministers . 
it talks about those who built this great country , who devoted so much time and energy and who sacrificed so much in order to foster the spiritual and cultural growth of our community and the country . 
instead of putting up a shiny new office that million dollars could have provided emergency shelter for 30,000 homeless Canadians . 
almost every major U.S. petroleum producer , the minister said , had indicated support for the decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to forbid MMT being marketed as a gasoline additive '' . 
i would like to know where the member stands on what the secretary of state said . 
it does not impact on you . " 
there is the Young Offenders Act . 
it is very disturbing when a person makes $ 65,000 and he can barely make it because of the tax burden imposed by the government . 
the second and most important point is that in the throne speech we indicated our commitment to the enhancement of the infrastructure in the rural and urban areas of the country . 
by tomorrow , when she makes her announcement , it will have been 267 days . 
we make up those organizations . 
for once , Mr. Pierre Gravel was of the opinion that we were doing our work by creating a filibuster to stop Bill C - 82 in its tracks , because , among other things , the bill provided life sentences for impaired driving causing death . 
what is fair for the goose is fair for the gander . 
how can this minister stand in her place and not tell the truth , that her riding did not - 
Mr. Speaker , I propose that all motions which are selected for debate now and later be deemed to have been moved , seconded and read . 
the Government of Canada , through the Department of Justice , should institute a study - 
however , security services are being cut , even though we have had fatal accidents . 
i do not think I could speak as knowledgeably today if I had not experienced life on their land . 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay 
Mr. Speaker , if the reference is to briefings for journalists , these are certainly not secret briefings . 
that was also regarded as an attack upon the institution of marriage . 
what has happened now is they have said that they will leave it up to the individual chiefs . 
U.S. border state politicians are increasing their rhetoric and are once again starting to rattle their trade sabres , threatening the livelihood of Canadian agricultural producers . 
some provinces cannot afford to do more . 
the Liberals just cannot stand the notion of freedom of speech . 
it is absolutely astonishing when we hear , and when the Canadian public hears , that there are companies which received money that did not even fill out an application . 
i am asking for unanimous consent to do that . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
the 301 members of the House are part of the legislative branch and will be able to express their views and vote on this issue . 
this government wants to ensure that children are equipped with all the capacities they need to be ready to learn when they begin school and to grow into healthy productive adults . 
another amendment concerns electronic voting . 
can Canada work to ensure the primacy of the United Nations in resolving conflict ? 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased today to speak to Bill C - 2 , the Canada Elections Act . 
the Late Sandra Schmirler 
i want to ask the member what his concerns are . 
at about the same time , successive governments began mandating Devco to attain commercial viability . 
Mr. Speaker , I do not comment on RCMP investigations . 
that is what he said . 
quite simply , when I was appointed Solicitor General of Canada , 70 % of the people in our federal institutions were alcoholics or had drug problems . 
( 2 ) The committee designated or established for the purpose of subsection ( 1 ) shall , as soon as practicable , undertake a comprehensive review of the provisions and operation of this Act and shall , within two years after the review is undertaken , submit a report to the Senate . " 
the government appreciates the hon. member ' s concern for the national highway system and commends him for bringing this matter to the attention of the House . 
hon. Michel Cogger : 
is he committed to doing it ? 
the senators sitting across from me - Senator Perrault and Senator Austin , both of whom are from British Columbia - know how badly this agreement has been dealt with . 
that is what Canadians were seriously horrified about . 
criminal Code 
remembrance Day 
it is very complex out there and our embassies struggle with a variety of people . 
concurrence IN VOTE 20 A - INDUSTRY 
the fact that he is appointed by the party in office creates a serious problem . 
member after member of that party are defecting and resigning because they cannot tolerate the positions being taken . 
from the 1920 s to the 1950 s , the Nisga ' a and other first nations ' efforts to have their rights recognized and practise their culture were restricted . 
nays 
* * * 
madam Speaker , the bill specifically recognizes the legitimacy of this movement by stating that any province can ask any question it wishes , but it would seek clarity on both the question and the majority . 
the EI clause , introduced in 1993 , goes a long way towards explaining why the rate of coverage for young people between the ages of 20 and 24 has dropped from 49.1 % in 1993 to 26.6 % in 1998 . 
Mr. Speaker , further to the introduction of a bill denying the fundamental rights of Quebecers , I have here parts of a report on the territorial integrity of the province of Quebec in the event that it achieves sovereignty , presented to the committee to examine matters relating to the accession of Qu é bec to sovereignty in May of 1992 , at the Quebec national assembly , which states that a sovereign Quebec would undergo no changes in its present boundaries . 
banking , Trade and Commerce 
Mr. Ryan added furthermore that , by wanting to make parliament the arbiter of clarity in the referendum question and result , contrary to the prerogatives of the National Assembly , the Liberal government was contravening the very principles of democracy . 
Mr. Speaker , I think you will see on page 244 of Beauchesne ' s that there is such a thing as the indivisibility of the Crown principle . 
i have taken part in such negotiations . 
i believe that you would find , Mr. Speaker , consent for the following motion : 
i will comment briefly on the importance of ongoing communication between the government and the public . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
members 
when I restated that I was the surviving spouse she asked for my name and " the name of the deceased '' . 
Mr. Speaker , I have here the speech the Prime Minister of Canada delivered in Hull on November 28 , 1999 , where he says that the referendum questions , both in 1980 and in 1995 , were clear . 
this could very easily create a paradise environment for lawyers . 
this successful company employs close to 3,000 people worldwide . 
in Quebec , we are determined that we will never allow the Liberal government to interfere in our areas of responsibility . 
motion No. 143 
we are at Motion No. 307 . 
ask a question . 
motion No. 116 
he bragged that there is a limit on the treaty right . 
the moneys set aside for economic adjustment are inadequate even by the government ' s own estimates which placed the need at $ 300 million . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Canadians are confident in their economy and they are confident in their government . 
we can put in place all the RCMP and all the police assistance that we want in communities , but we must address the basic fundamental attitudes of young people and tell them that they have to respect one another . 
members 
i congratulate my colleagues from Bras d ' Or - Cape Breton and Acadie - Bathurst for having worked strenuously to achieve that kind of commitment from the government . 
government RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
the finance committee will now be out . 
also , the ramifications of this decision will be with us , our children and our children ' s children for generations . 
my question relates to the status of Inter - Canadian Inc. , Canada ' s largest independent regional air carrier . 
members of the Canadian heritage committee , along with many witnesses who made presentations to the committee , helped identify a number of glaring weaknesses within the legislation . 
we did so in a spirit of co - operation , knowing that for young people across Canada we could bring the best from all areas including Quebec and do so in a very positive way . 
that fact goes to the very heart of our history , of our existence as a country . 
addressing their needs and ensuring their safety have involved many agencies in our communities : government and social services , law enforcement , and as voluntary and non - profit organizations . 
a recent article in Le Devoir about the health of seniors in Quebec described the situation facing the province ' s beleaguered Department of Health and Social Services : 
from a personal point of view , the fact that Canada is continuing its involvement in space is somewhat gratifying in the sense that my uncle is considered one of Canada ' s space pioneers . 
motion No. 18 
( the House divided on the motion , which was agreed to on the following division : ) 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
Quebec - Possible Conditions of Referendum - Role of Senate 
i will read directly from the Debates of the Senate . 
Mr. Jim Pankiw 
i declare Motion No. 4 lost . 
if context needs to be provided , then a summary section is the standard practice . 
in other words , why bring a bill to us telling us that we have no power ? 
if he would understand farmers at all in western Canada he would know that they are well - educated people . 
this is the same man who signed the treaty of 1760 . 
Mr. Ken Epp : 
it is underhanded and it is simply wrong . 
every time they try to escape from the dependence in which they are trapped , they must seek the minister ' s permission . 
i was fascinated to hear about his research on hepatitis B , which was conducted in a Canadian institute at a very high level . 
government MPs spent six months telling the Premier of British Columbia that it was not a template , that it rested on its own particular historical facts . 
the government said no , the committee should not travel . 
these are the words of a great Quebecer with vast experience in political and federal politics whose integrity and political judgment have earned him the esteem of his fellow citizens regardless of political stripe . 
for example , criminal charges were laid in September of this year against a refiner and two retailers of gasoline for price maintenance . 
keynote speakers included renowned medical researcher and early childhood development expert , Dr. Fraser Mustard ; Dr. John Wootton , Executive Director of the Office of Rural Health for Health Canada ; and our eminent colleague and children ' s issues advocate , the hon. member for Don Valley West . 
i will be splitting my time . 
section 237 would also accord greater strength to the charter of rights and for Canadians to enjoy property . 
members 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
members 
that is what we need , not a bunch of ridiculous programs that come forward , as we have seen in the past from this government , such as TAGS . 
members of the NDP are trying to justify their position . 
what a joke . 
Mr. Speaker , if my hon. colleague wanted an answer he could have informed me of the situation before question period . 
i am disgusted at the Liberal government and its total disregard for the democratic process in the House . 
we need to honour our heroes . 
senator Grafstein : 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
the answer yesterday evening at 7 p.m. was " Never , there is no question of it '' . 
she has listened to a wide range of views on the matter in order to come up with a solution to this problem . 
it is as if there had been no committee hearings at all with respect to this bill . 
when properly structured , they may provide roads at a lower cost and more quickly than traditional procurement methods . 
members 
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. parliamentary secretary , but time has run out . 
presence IN GALLERY 
under Bill C - 8 , each department will have jurisdiction over its own areas or zones . 
we are asking the court to rule , as I said , that the treaty , the Nisga ' a final agreement , is unconstitutional on each of those grounds . 
it is certainly not a point of order . 
in my view , if we carry this forward to 60 agreements there will not be a commercial fishery in Canada . 
Checkmate . 
it seems the Liberal government has devised a new process for drafting the budget this year . 
this proposal strikes us as a bit strange . 
i am wondering if Senator Murray could explain the apparent change in position . 
we know that when the auditor general criticizes something the government has done , the public listens to him . 
honourable senators , these Main Estimates support the government ' s request for Parliament ' s authority to spend $ 50.1 billion under program authorities for which annual approval is required . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
in fact , Canadians were shut out of the committee hearings . 
once the way was paved , a movement started to emerge . 
there are other reasons for setting out the circumstances under which the Government of Canada would negotiate around a referendum result . 
at the same time as it does that , the advisory panel also has absolutely no teeth connected with it . 
the hon. member indicated that a lawsuit was launched against him by a senator following the distribution to his constituents of a bulk mailing of 16 pages on the subject of the Senate . 
i say to my friends opposite , what evidence do we have of the impact of globalization ? 
in 1986 , Ontario became the second province , after Quebec , to amend its human rights code , which is the equivalent of Quebec ' s charter of human rights , and to include sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination . 
but once you had stood up , you said that the member for Chambly was seated and had not asked for the floor , when all I was doing was complying with the standing orders . 
given that this bill has been supported by all parties in the other place , by provincial and territorial ministers of justice and law enforcement authorities throughout Canada , I believe it merits our support . 
she got away from the treaty and began working in a hospital in the Beaverlodge area . 
without his determined efforts we would not be here today . 
in 1993 , also an important year , the government opposite came to power in October of that year . 
Mr. Eric Lowther 
Mr. Speaker , the lobster season only opened yesterday for lobster fishing areas 33 and 34 in Nova Scotia and already the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has shown how unprepared he and his department are . 
members 
it is the result of close to 25 years of negotiations . 
why would we have points within a bill that we know the courts will reject ? 
( the House adjourned at 2.31 p.m. ) 
as a matter of fact , that is one of the main planks of the Reform Party ' s policy . 
Mr. Speaker , I met with the ministers of agriculture from two western provinces today . 
some hon. members : 
Mr. Janko Peric 
i fail to understand why it was not felt advisable to try to use them as a point of departure for drafting legislation that meets the needs of Canadians in several respects where the Code , which , as you know is a compromise , might not be up to the task '' . 
bill C - 4 . 
perhaps the Republicans should check the historical record to see what eventually happens to empires which trust more in their weapons than in the will of God for a just , peaceful and non - nuclear world . 
in the opinion of the Chair , there should be two speeches of unlimited time . 
the first ones to make that assessment would be the government of the province . 
( k ) to those honours , distinctions , and awards that are not hereditary in character such as life peerages , knighthoods , military and chivalrous orders ; and 
citizens around the globe realize that there is a cost to making trade the first and foremost consideration over the protection of the environment that supports us . 
members 
in fact this agreement will guarantee that the Nisga ' a people will see another hundred years of poverty in their communities . 
members 
division No. 202 
we have much left to do . 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
the selection of returning officers is also an issue that will have to be addressed . 
this is one more in a series of similar petitions signed by thousands in my riding and in the ridings of a number of other members who have presented similar petitions in the House . 
in all fairness the minister and his officials would probably read and study the recommendation . 
i raise this point in the proceedings to give the government fair warning that it is completely dissatisfying the people of the country and the members of the House with its arrogant treatment of committees . 
that is what we should have done , but I am afraid it will have to be done in another bill . 
we are , therefore , sensitive to the pain of those Canadians who may at one time have been victimized by the inhumanity of war , or by bigotry and oppression . 
business OF THE HOUSE 
the court further stated : " While we recognize their right '' - third parties - `` to participate in the electoral process , independent individuals and groups cannot be subject to the same financial rules as candidates or political parties and be allowed the same spending limits . 
i happen to represent a riding in the province of Manitoba . 
the flag was presented to me on the understanding that I would present it to the minister . 
they are rewarded . 
i will be referring later to some very distinguished Canadians who believe that Bill C - 20 in no way infringes upon the rights of provincial legislatures to do as they wish in framing questions . 
i can only wonder why the member for Davenport is trying to upset this balance that we have now achieved on the coast of British Columbia . 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) : 
some hon. members : 
" Nisga ' a Final Agreement . " 
the federal Solicitor General , with the support of the Minister of Justice , undertook at the 1998 meeting to determine how best to do this , in consultation with provincial partners . 
one example is that $ 1 million will go to the United Nations for fuel for heating systems in Pristina which will provide about 40 % of the city ' s heat , including hospitals and schools . 
he will not propose any changes . 
the Export Development Corporation is in strange position . 
i have gone so far as to say - and I would say this if we had a Conservative government , an NDP government or a Reform government - that if something is not done , and there is an accident , responsibility will lie directly on cabinet , the Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defence . 
motion No. 297 negatived 
hopefully high ranking scientists will be allowed to make decisions without interference from the government . 
perhaps we can clarify it . 
division No. 423 
the other bill exists but it has never been tabled in this place . 
they have worked relentlessly to have aboriginal and treaty rights recognized . 
ladies and Gentlemen : 
the hon. minister of Indian affairs . 
sound principles of management and conservation based on well grounded science must be implemented . 
not all murderers deserve the death penalty , but in most heinous cases such as Clifford Olson , Paul Bernardo and a Karla Homolka the punishment must fit the crime . 
you would know Mac Wilson from Renfrew . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough 
in Ontario , the provincial government eliminated its business occupancy tax . 
reporting waste in initiatives that the government has strongly supported and publicized can be more problematic . 
she would hand out these cards . 
we have a quorum . 
that is what is wrong and that is what is relevant with this bill . 
Mr. Joe McGuire 
one important exception , mainly amendments introduced dealing with questions as to the certainty of future benefits , the final agreement passed in the British Columbia legislature contained no significant amendment to the agreement in principle tabled in 1996 . 
in times of awareness , more is better . 
they have told me they have looked at the Nisga ' a agreement . 
action is long overdue , as there are now some 6,000 formulated products registered in Canada . 
i therefore whole heartily support their request . 
your predecessor was a president of the Liberal Party , too . 
we all listened intently and politely to the minister . 
an hon. member : 
homelessness differs in communities across Canada and requires a response specific to that community . 
social Affairs , Science & Technology Committee 
do we want to put in place a registry ? 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
it seems like a long time ago , our first caucus in Collingwood , where indeed all members of the Liberals caucus were very , very worried about the state of medical research in this country . 
imagine a country that was hundreds of nations warring within the bosom of a single state . 
honourable senators , I apologize if I took the leader by surprise . 
there was a shift in population in the late 1800 s , driven by missionaries . 
i can assure the member that we will be bearing her remarks and her proposal in mind when this legislation comes forward . 
i think people have heard of him . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
Ms. Val Meredith 
we do not know anything about that . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
i am also hopeful that by the time this debate is over , Canadians in all parts of Canada and members of parliament representing all parts of Canada will understand that this bill and the agreement to which it gives effect have ramifications for them . 
nationally only 36 % of the unemployed qualify for EI benefits . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
we continue to do so . 
the Nisga ' a agreement seems disturbing , surprising , a thorn in the side of our national tranquillity . 
bank ACT 
he is the one mainly responsible for the mess in hospitals , but that does not bother him in the least . 
it would thus agree to members of this House knowing our international obligations and to the enshrinement of a practice that was carried on for a number of years in this House . 
we will see to it , when the time comes for us to introduce amendments , that the bill gives a larger role to the provinces . 
i will conclude by addressing what was not in this speech . 
it was founded in 1938 as the Chair in Poetry , and then in 1984 it became the Consultant . 
however , that is not the way the world is in some parts . 
* * * 
motion No. 437 negatived 
the international community has identified the fight against organized crime as a priority issue . 
it defined " the withdrawal of life - sustaining treatment " as " stopping treatment that has the potential to sustain life " ; for example , removing a respirator . 
of course the stakes are very high ... 
any violation of the parole conditions , which includes the commission of any further crime , but can , and often does , include other conditions such as remaining free of drugs , results in a revocation of parole and the convicted person is sent back to prison to complete their life sentence . 
i suggest that he do so . 
it is to limit competition on the ballot . 
bill C - 326 . 
i am sure that in her study of this matter , the honourable senator is aware that one of the principles at stake is the Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
i think this is something that should be of concern to the justice committee when it comes to act on the motion proposed by the Bloc Quebecois . 
the next question is on Motion No. 287 . 
Mr. Speaker , does the Minister of Health intend to respond to the concerns expressed by his deputy minister and give his officials the appropriate resources to enable them to do their work ? 
Arabism versus Africanism will create contradictions difficult to overcome . 
osteoporosis Month 
why is it that whenever the government makes a mistake , taxpayers end up paying the bill ? 
Mr. Mac Harb 
i would like to know why the Chair prevents the minister from answering before the minister has even decided whether he will answer or hide behind the fact that he does not have to answer . 
some hon. members : 
i think the scientists themselves are looking to the new act to free up dollars for actual research projects and that the money will go into research . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
maintaining and enhancing our standard of living require a comprehensive strategy to take us into the 21 st century . 
my parents ' fight for custody was the scariest thing in the world and it made me realize that marriage is stupid and having kids is something I ' ll never ever do . 
in addition , will the government now review its policy on Cuba , since quiet diplomacy has obviously failed ? 
recognizing the critical impact of diabetes the government recently announced a five year $ 115 million Canadian diabetes strategy to help prevent and control the disease . 
years and years and years of letting the inner city of Winnipeg rot has had a very predictable outcome and consequence in the form of a permanent underclass . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 428 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
some hon. members : 
members 
at least the framework for an agreement exists and the envoys from neighbouring countries have been active since the beginning of this year . 
ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister ; ministers should be as open as possible with Parliament , refusing to provide information only when disclosure would not be in the public interest - 
the minister has already referred to this . 
could there be some better language ? 
as the government moves into not only a new year but a new decade , a new century , and a new millennium , I would think it would want to do that too . 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities made short work of the Prime Minister ' s simplistic line about the financial problem at Human Resources Development Canada being limited to $ 250 . 
the recommendations in the report reflect very clearly what the representations were . 
i will deviate from my text for a moment . 
human RIGHTS 
Mr. Speaker , I am presenting a petition this morning on behalf of the rural mail couriers who work for Canada Post . 
of course not , Mr. Speaker .

Mr. John Bryden 
honourable senators , that is why I gave percentages in my preamble . 
the report does not go far enough in this regard .

Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) : 
besides , concerned by the fact that Quebecers are attracted to the concept of partnership , the federal government claims that is has the power to order that an eventual referendum should deal with only one issue , what Ottawa calls secession , which , again , would go against the spirit and the letter of the supreme court ' s opinion .

hon. Douglas Roche : 
i will conclude by saying that there is no doubt that the federal government should withdraw immediately from the administration of criminal justice and leave it to the provinces . 
i must say that by virtue of having a sign such as this , it reminds me of how much in the trough both the Conservatives and the Liberals are . 
unfortunately , for too many years first nations have not fully enjoyed the benefits of this great land , in part because they have had limited access to fish , forests , minerals and other natural resources . 
following the referendum it was again the official opposition which led the debate , turning the focus of the debate away from the negative results from secession into positive nation building efforts by trying to reconstruct the federation .

the next question is on the main motion . 
i want to tell all Canadians that we must protect our environment . 
the Senate committee was not alone in recommending clarification of the criminal law regarding the permissibility of providing , in order to alleviate suffering , treatment that may shorten life . 
in doing so , they will be joining a massive wave of support which has come in from across the country . 
Mr. Mauril B é langer 
for example , in some ridings people who are really against the government might show up in greater numbers to vote to kick the government out than those who are tepidly in favour of the government . 
there is constant bad blood that inhibits their ability to protect Canadians .

in the intervening time a too pre - emptive concern with special constitutional issues thought to relate to Quebec tended to kill off discussion of other issues . 
however , the order that we adopted earlier today specifically said that the debate would be concluded at 5.15 p.m. , which we have done .

it would oversee relationships in order to promote , respect and uphold the aboriginal and treaty rights of aboriginal people , the honour of the Crown , and the spirit and intent of the treaties , self - government , and related agreements and legislation . 
this legislation is at least a start in the direction the government has to go . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
money is flowing in from everywhere and has to be distributed . 
that is because of the approach of the government to work in partnership at the community level to focus on the issues that will make a difference for citizens in those ridings to use their skills and abilities to diversify the economy . 
we have to talk about the multifunctionality of agriculture with respect to the environment . 
these clauses are needed whenever a new collective agreement is reached which changes the previous conditions of employment . 
they urged the federal government to raise family allowances . 
the industry itself has a lot of confidence in its own capabilities .

second , we have the rather spurious and unfounded argument by the member for Brandon - Souris who tossed out his conclusion that this is a bad piece of legislation because consultations are not included in the legislation . 
we do support him in that and I sincerely wish him the very best in finding the solutions that will appease all of those who are looking for a peaceful resolution to the matter . 
Mr. Speaker , in this specific instance , as soon as I became aware of the allegations , I asked that the matter be referred directly to the ethics counsellor .

perhaps when it comes to education there will be rights to vote . 
that is why , now that I am calmed down , I wish to make sure that I correct every step that I may have taken incorrectly . 
Mr. Speaker , as you know , if you have to take a lot of time standing , waiting for order , that uses up time which would otherwise go toward questions and answers . 
at the last election , Canadians were asked to vote for the Liberals because they promised to provide accountability , integrity and transparency . 
by doubling the 1997 - 98 levels of research funding to $ 500 million in the year 2001 - 02 Canada will regain some ground it lost to the cuts over the past six years .

i must interrupt the hon. member at this point as his time has expired .

Mr. Ted McWhinney

what we are trying to do with this bill - and I thought it was talked about very eloquently today by the witnesses who came before the committee - is create a structure around the most important set of discussions our country could have . 
what is the purpose of it ?

Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold 
honourable senators - 
hear , hear ! 
this government , the Senate and the House of Commons , the Prime Minister of Canada and the people of Canada , cannot ignore the serious crisis situation facing the agricultural community because it is a very serious national problem for the whole country . 
it was because he realized the impact of his misbehaviour on his family , community and friends and that it was not the way to behave in a decent society .

does the minister care enough to get to the bottom of this and clean up this mess by an independent inquiry ? 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
however , according to our criteria , at least at this time , it does not meet the criteria for an emergency debate today . 
this means that employees and employers will save a further $ 1.2 billion next year , bringing total savings , compared to the rate that prevailed in 1994 , to $ 5.2 billion . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
through the costly and discriminatory Firearms Act , the government is depriving law - abiding Canadian citizens of their property . 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member refers again to a billion dollars . 
an independent advisory committee decides which stamps are to be issued . 
that is just silly . 
that a Special Committee of the Senate be appointed to reassess Canada ' s anti - drug legislation and policies , to carry out a broad consultation of the Canadian public to determine the specific needs of various regions of the country , where social problems associated with the trafficking and use of illegal drugs are more in evidence , to develop proposals to disseminate information about Canada ' s anti - drug policy and , finally , to make recommendations for an anti - drug strategy developed by and for Canadians under which all levels of government to work closely together to reduce the harm associated with the use of illegal drugs ;

we want the best returning officers we can have .

in the case of the definition of the terms " children " or " vulnerable persons " , officials of the Department of the Solicitor General answered our concerns as follows : 
it would be different perhaps if we were giving speeches . 
i , personally , was not amused . 
Mr. Speaker , the solicitor general has skated very well on the issue so far when he said that he knew immediately of the disclosure . 
* * * 
my colleague from Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough has mentioned the motorcycle gangs that have increased in cities like Montreal . 
instead of closing the fishery , as I mentioned earlier , the minister took the harder road of negotiations . 
i have spoken to veterans who have been left to sit in wet and soiled diapers for the better part of a day due to staff shortages and institutional indifference . 
there is not enough money in Canada for the government to pay out these demands . 
however , for many of our veterans , their battle for survival has just begun .

they dump that 10 % or 15 % overproduction on the world markets and it kills our agricultural prices . 
the hon. member knows very well that we do not comment on the presence or absence of members in the House . 
it is absolutely ludicrous that we could even get a handle on the situation . 
i hope my comment is not unparliamentary . 
the Americans go by 50,000 and we go by 100,000 .

one of the big concerns in the Nisga ' a agreement was for private property rights given to the individual Nisga ' a people , particularly with regard to any spousal disagreement or break up of marriage . 
Mr. Speaker , on October 27 , 1997 , Human Resources Development Canada had the hon. member for Rosemont approve a project to create 106 jobs in his riding . 
of course at the time the federal government would have denied that . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
there are two points here . 
i agree that Canadians have something to say about the budget . 
the court also found there were no grounds for a claim of discrimination on the basis of differential treatment of rural and urban residents . 
the shadow cast over this program by mismanagement has fueled the Reform Party ' s call for an end to such programs . 
the agreement I was referring to earlier has the force of law . 
he described the limiting of parliamentary debate on the Nisga ' a treaty as an unacceptable slight to British Columbians and to all Canadians . 
in terms of the mechanics of this chamber , could the honourable senator suggest a way in which we and our aboriginal colleagues could put pressure on the other place to meet the commitments , both constitutional or non - constitutional , that are fundamental as values in this Canadian society so that we can be together as one people ? 
will he judge how they have practised medicine ? 
far be it from me to paraphrase objections that have been raised in debate by various parties , honourable senators .

some hon. members : 
the Speaker : 
our goal is as simple as branding Canada as one of the most forward looking and innovative nations in the world . 
in fact , their opinion will be received and reviewed . 
the greater Toronto area in the last two and a half years has been blessed with one of the most exciting economies the country has seen in the last 20 to 30 years . 
the data bank should be operational by June 2000 and will be administered by the RCMP , which now runs six forensic laboratories .

Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
what is the minister doing in practical terms to help Canadians take advantage of these technologies while we face the climate change situation ? 
it is a process that does not require the consent of a number of the provinces across Canada that a constitutional amendment would entail .

whether it is on closure , Bill C - 68 , the committee approach to things , satellite TV or whatever it is , the government operates like a dictatorship . 
on the Order : 
the Speaker : 
as I said on several other occasions , there may be good public policy reasons for disclosing information about individuals that is held by governments after 20 years , or sending the information to the archives , but that is not the bill we are debating today . 
however , I have some concerns . 
the secretary - general also suggested that the council consider the deployment of preventive peacekeeping operations such as UNPREDEP in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 1995 , or other preventive monitoring presences , and he noted the need to address hate media assets in situations of ongoing conflict . 
however , many executives and senior management suddenly were laid off , and it was a new experience for them to be unemployed . 
by the time bone fractures occur , the damage is already severe and can result in serious spine , hip and wrist injuries .

pursuant to order of reference of Thursday , February 10 , 2000 your committee has considered Bill C - 20 , an act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec Secession Reference , and has agreed , on Thursday , February 24 , 2000 , to report it without amendments . 
therefore , the Acting Speaker acted rightfully .

Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the Government ) : 
that is an area that the courts must define . 
the basis of my answer comes from an experience that I had in the House 10 years ago when I sat in opposition . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik 
in Schreiber , the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court referred to extraterritorial application of the Charter . 
when one quotes from a newspaper article or letter from anyone who is not a player in a debate , that quote becomes your quote . 
hon. Paul Martin 
the major legislative developments include Bill C - 20 , which recently added the new offence of deceptive telemarketing to the Competition Act . 
* * * 
my problem is the means the government has taken to reach that goal . 
in fact , they even went on in the letter to encourage the Prime Minister to consider the use of the notwithstanding clause to send a clear message that Canada ' s charter of rights and freedoms would never again be used to defend sexual abuse of Canadian children .

Dr. Lise Fortier established the first family planning clinic in Quebec and worked tirelessly to obtain the right to choose for Canadian women . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
over those years , of course , given the changes in technology and in communications across the country , all sorts of smaller changes have been made to it , trying to keep it up to date and so on . 
the shareholders of Air Canada will need to reach a decision before long and they must have all of the information in hand with which to make that decision an informed one . 
it is certainly undemocratic . 
well done . 
for instance , we would like to strengthen or improve the exercise of federal legislative and administrative authority in the following areas : defence , foreign affairs , monetary policy , regulation of financial institutions , criminal law , definition of national standards , equalization payments , international trade and interprovincial trade . 
his speech in that respect was full and accurate , and I only say that I agree with all of it .

Helmut Kohl is a perfect example . 
the requirement to be controlled in fact by Canadians will not be changed . 
our commitment to housing is visible in communities right across the country . 
what we are asking for , and the request comes from consumers , is a real public inquiry that will include - and we must not forget them this year - independent producers , in order to shed light on the production costs of a litre of gas , of a litre of diesel and of a litre of fuel oil .

honourable senators , among the many crimes in our society , murder and rape are two of the most vile . 
the book should have been more properly named , " A Place for Liberals , A Story of the NCC . " 
it should not be injected into the debate when it is surrounded by controversy and all these peripheral effects . 
in our prayers , honourable senators , we should ask that this government come to its senses and reclaim Canada ' s position as a leader in human rights everywhere in the world . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question . 
however , we hope that the issue will be thoroughly reviewed by the committees of the House and the Senate in the weeks to come .

Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
in short , the Reform Party intends to support the main thrust of the bill although we have some concerns and we will be introducing some amendments to address some of those concerns . 
nice try . 
colleagues , we are coming very close now so please , let us back off just a bit . 
to suggest otherwise is nonsense .

i want to raise some points that show how unclear this bill is . 
i have looked with sympathy and interest to the motion by the opposition Bloc Quebecois , as I say , granted the predisposition to examine every motion from the other side .

on March 12 , Poland also became a full and unrestricted member of NATO . 
this focus on the bill ' s principle has led to a practice that limits the kind of amendments that can be moved at this stage . 
the supreme court was very clear that it is the democratic right of provinces to address the issue of separation , but that it could not be done unilaterally . 
i believe the defence of our rights and privileges can only be accomplished with your finding a prima facie case of privilege and / or contempt , Mr. Speaker , and I urge you to do so . 
in other words , the income tax department would not take all the profit in a good year .

this would lead to greater diligence in the bureaucracy in introducing regulations , greater scrutiny both by the bureaucracy and within the elected Chamber of these regulations , and ultimately a more effective and efficient regulatory burden which would provide greater benefit to Canadians and wreak less havoc with Canadian enterprises .

the punch line , which will hit the citizens of Cape Breton straight in the stomach , is that once the government pushes Bill C - 11 through the House , it will no longer be obligated to help clean up the mess that its 30 years of mismanagement of Devco have created .

honourable senators , with respect to the Canada Pension Plan , obviously that is being reviewed . 
the committee in this House should show up the committee in Quebec City and do the kind of travelling that is not being done there . 
we would all acknowledge the fact that there are young people , very few in number , who really have to be set aside so that society is protected from their behaviour . 
if only for the sake of those Canadians , civilian and military , an inquiry is more than justified . 
the recession caused two tier wage schemes to be adopted as a means of fighting the economic recession and saved jobs from being lost .

i ask for the support of my colleagues opposite to table this document which , I am sure , will enlighten them on this issue . 
however , if you go back to the Debates of the Senate for November 3 , it is clear that when Senator Oliver proposed the motion he said :

one of the difficulties confronting the Senate is that people are not listening . 
fisheries 
he went on to cite a number of decisions that leave a great deal to be desired in their interpretation and application . 
what we are saying to the House is that we deserve a say . 
i know the government is afraid to start discussing these options because it has shown no leadership when it comes to vision , when it comes to how to make the country work better . 
that has been the complaint I have heard over and over again from my Quebec colleagues , many of whom feel there is no other option but to split from this country . 
all the Conservatives spoke of for nine years was about what terrible financial shape the country was in . 
some hon. members : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise pursuant to Standing Order 36 to present a petition from the great people of the province of Nova Scotia , especially the wonderful cities of Lower Sackville , Bedford , Beaverbank , Timberlea and the surrounding communities . 
i would argue that if we have a big surplus coming our way and we have a tremendous debt burden and extraordinarily high taxes , then it makes sense to devote that money to lowering our debt and our tax burden .

honourable senators , in reply to the question of Senator Roche , I will make two observations . 
if a drunk driver causes the death of another person , that drunk driver is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life . 
we remember what happened in election terms . 
everybody is starting to feel the pinch as their receivables escalate and skyrocket into numbers they have never seen before , with no end in sight . 
is it agreed , honourable senators ? 
who could claim , without raising an eyebrow , that this system is truly equitable , transparent and accessible , a system that allows corporations , which do not have the right to vote , to meddle in the electoral process by making contributions far beyond the capability of the ordinary voter , and thus unduly influencing the political policy of the parties and the candidates seeking votes ? 
it does not matter whom we are talking about . 
honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
i hope all members of the House agree that we must give very careful thought to the Department of Transport ' s procedure and , at the same time , to the importance of priority in achieving nuclear disarmament . 
that little wee problem happens to be the breadbasket of Canada . 
i want to progress and make a better future by learning from past mistakes . 
i am getting to the point . 
paired 
on this point I believe the member has a valid argument that perhaps a parliamentary committee should be struck to thoroughly investigate ways in which we can strengthen the protection that Canadians need in ensuring that their personal information remains just that , personal . 
on average , Quebec received about 14 % of the federal funding for R and D , and so far , nothing has changed . 
madam Speaker , I note from the supply day motion that the Progressive Conservatives have attempted to cover all of the hot button issues they think are facing Canada today . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
that gives some indication to the viewing public and those in the House and the gallery of the need for improving the legislation . 
before I move to the actual substance of the bill I would first like to ask a question . 
motion No. 388 negatived 
hon. Dan Hays ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) , with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 58 ( 1 ) ( a ) , moved : 
i resent that . 
i should like to make the answer as brief and direct as I can , but it may require more than a " yes " or a " no " . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
hon. John Buchanan : 
honourable senators , lest anyone confuse our geography with isolation or insularity , let me put your minds as rest . 
i might suggest that the bill could also mention citizenship , passports , pensions , creditor confidence , the Canadian dollar , international agreements , an access corridor if the province is in the centre of Canada , defence issues , military assets and a potential rejoining of Canada . 
some hon. members : 
therefore I would ask for the unanimous consent of the House to transfer all the Reform motions which are not in the name of the hon. member for North Vancouver or the hon. member for Elk Island to be moved by the hon. member for North Vancouver and seconded by the hon. member for Elk Island . 
happily , a provision of this sort is found in Bill C - 2 .

as Canadian citizens we are justly proud of our first place ranking in the United Nations human development index , but such classifications are meaningless for the individuals who struggle every day to find something to eat and do not know where they will be sleeping at night . 
we will point out , piece by piece , our concerns with this legislation because it is flawed and needs to be dealt with more thoroughly . 
honourable senators , I support the motion which is presently before us . 
since that time , there has been a dramatic 20 % drop in reservations with InterCanadian . 
examining more closely the vote itself in Confederation in 1867 , the British North America Act said that the control of the federal franchise , the vote , would remain a provincial matter until parliament decided otherwise . 
it has been very hard for me to sit in such close physical proximity to the Reform Party members and hear them and their outrageous comments for these past many months . 
i am asking the question to the current minister , since the Minister for International Trade does not want to answer for his actions . 
i think it would enlighten our colleagues opposite . 
i was hoping to speak to it earlier . 
Dr. Powell did the same in Toronto . 
in 1998 inflows to Canada were $ 22.9 billion , but Canadians invested a record $ 39.8 billion abroad . 
my guess is that the vast amount of that money will be spent on the ice storm . 
Mr. Speaker , I am very happy today to participate in the debate on Bill C - 4 . 
yeas 
there is no doubt that , as they said at the U.S. Democratic convention in 1968 , the whole world is watching . 
i am very patient , but there are limits . 
it has been mentioned on a continent - wide syndicated radio program . 
yet the minister still drags his heels and feet along the ground . 
today we have in our gallery two Speakers from Barbados and a delegation . 
i want to address the member ' s last question first about the financial information strategy . 
i would also like to tell the House how much the phenomenon of globalization changes the nature of exclusion as well . 
the Speaker : 
if the hon. member would look at what is happening in Atlantic Canada , it is working . 
i think that 4 % to 5 % is high . 
we know that 52 % of Newfoundlanders voted in favour of joining confederation . 
while the bill will deal firmly with crimes of youth violence , it will also ensure that the criminal justice system has the flexibility to deal with the many other cases involving non - violent offences .

this is a fairly major entry , a whole long paragraph . 
a negative vote on Motion No. 96 requires the question to be put on Motions Nos. 97 and 98 . 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member who just asked the question and his party were one of a number of people and parties that asked us a year ago to do something to assist producers so that the precipitous drop in incomes in 1998 in comparison to previous years could be assisted . 
it seems to me that the member for Roberval and his colleagues are underestimating Quebecers , their intelligence and their vision of Canada and the world . 
the inhabitants of the beaches area have been deprived of this essential service because the water table has been contaminated for several years . 
senator Oliver : 
as for the financial resources earmarked by the governments of Canada and Quebec to fight organized crime , they seem clearly inadequate . 
the public will support it . 
in many ways , the motto of " Be Prepared , " which Baden - Powell himself noted was founded on his own initials and means that " you are always to be in a state of readiness in mind and body to do your duty , " has been a hallmark of this distinguished senator who I have always been so proud for so many years to call a true friend . 
yet , Amnesty International and others were pointing out that political opponents were being inappropriately jailed and not receiving fair trials and treatment . 
please proceed , Senator Fraser . 
there are grave concerns across the country about the allocation formula that is in place for the new 21 st century research chairs to be included in next week ' s budget .

honourable senators , as the vice - chair of the Committee on Internal Economy , Budgets and Administration , I , too , would like to welcome Gary O ' Brien and wish him every success in his work . 
we are doing other things in this act to enlarge the capacity of Canadians to participate in the voting process like extending voting hours and allowing people out of the country to vote more easily and more freely at embassies anywhere in the world .

Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
the convention altered this perception by recognizing children as individual persons , with rights to freedom of expression , association , assembly , religion and privacy . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
this is a constant muddle . 
Mr. Speaker , I want to touch on a couple of issues surrounding this debate that I , and probably many of my constituents , find somewhat puzzling . 
i found another one which states : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not know what standing order you are basing your ruling on that the point of order I am making deals with something you do not want to hear about . 
young OFFENDERS ACT 
on that basis , I commend this idea to you , Mr. Speaker . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
Mr. Speaker , I also ask that all Notices of Motions for the Production of Papers be allowed to stand . 
that came from the business community . 
the Speaker : 
oh , oh . 
otherwise , there could be a very great incentive to an accused person to offer a plea to criminal negligence or manslaughter , and a similar incentive to a crown attorney to accept it . 
with this vision , Canada will be the best place to live in the next century . 
unfortunately , they were not accepted , apparently out of concern for reaching a decision as efficiently and rapidly as possible . 
some of the stories are too drastic to tell .

on this side of the House we support de - politicizing economic decision making by eliminating grants , guarantees and subsidies . 
that is the fundamental question Canada faces as we begin the new millennium . 
recommendation 1 states : 
this centralizing recipe now includes a social union sauce , which could well further spoil relations between Ottawa and Quebec City . 
when I spoke of infiltration , one of the useful tools in law enforcement is infiltration of criminal groups . 
why does the hon. member not wake up , smell the coffee and understand what is happening on farms in western Canada ? 
they are asking why this message did not get through in terms of getting the extra $ 1.3 billion . 
yet , though our athletes and many of our fighting personnel wore the maple leaf with pride , it was not until 1964 that a veteran of World War I , Prime Minister Lester Pearson , took up the difficult task of persuading Canadians to formalize their private love affair with the red maple leaf in a new national flag . 
some individuals have been found to be residing in Canada because they have a bank account here or own property in the country without actually having ever lived in Canada . 
in spite of this fact he is supposed to remain at arm ' s length , and it does not look good . 
there will be an opportunity to consider the point of view of the hon. member . 
we saw that in the magazine debate . 
we know that to border on the catastrophic , particularly if you are in the air . 
the member for Saint - Maurice was then in an opposition party that was concerned with the fact that there was a majority government with 100 per cent of the power and less then half the vote .

hon. Paul Martin 
Mr. John Williams : 
it is my understanding that when a motion comes before the House of Commons the mover and seconder of the motion must be in the House , and if not you dispense with it . 
the Security Intelligence Review Committee will do a review , as I indicated previously , and it will have access to all CSIS documents . 
i think not . 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
as recently as last September , all the ministers of health agreed on priorities that we are working toward together to get that job done . 
it means that s . 7 affords no guarantee of compensation or even of a fair procedure for the taking of property by the government . 
however , if it is the wish of the honourable senators to speak , quite obviously they are free to do so . 
it will also help stem part of the brain drain by making this investment in our scientific community and will put the resources into medical research .

Mr. Speaker , according to the same internal audit report , in 97 % of the projects audited , the government paid out money to promoters without checking to see whether there were outstanding debts to Human Resources Development Canada , something that must be done . 
that is very significant .

right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
No. 
if anyone was thinking that as a Canadian citizen they had any of these rights or that somehow these rights were protected in Canadian law , I am sad to inform them that they are wrong . 
Quelle surprise . 
it is impossible for anyone to try to understand the logic behind a system that releases migrants after the hearing regardless of whatever it was that hearing determined . 
Mr. Speaker , as I indicated previously , the director of CSIS has indicated that the necessary steps have been taken to protect security .

what is more , a specific decision might not settle issues applicable to other regions . 
motion No. 120 
unfortunately , the government did not follow up on it . 
in conclusion , this is important legislation . 
that may be what it takes in order to save the family farm and make sure farmers do not have to sacrifice themselves until such time as we get the EU and the Americans in line on this . 
however , to apply in domestic law , they also require implementing legislation , and sometimes legislation from both a provincial legislative assembly and the federal parliament .

senator Kinsella : 
for whatever reason , I do not know . 
i worry about it every night and pray to God that my children are safe . 
for all intents and purposes , a corporation may contribute an unlimited amount to a political party . 
the Senate adjourned during pleasure . 
Mr. Speaker , what is the member doing specifically to make sure that whatever happens to the airline industry it will continue to provide services to small towns in Ontario and other provinces ? 
and the count having been taken : 
members 
Mr. Yvan Loubier : 
i do not think the government has thought a lot about these things . 
only 4,500 of those pardons concern sex offenders . 
the forestry and mining industries have suffered in British Columbia because of a lack of certainty that exists regarding resource ownership in the province . 
this happened in Montreal in the early 1990 s . 
how many millions will the economic uncertainty created by Lucien Bouchard cost Quebecers and Canadians ? 
i think it is very misguided to state that . 
a carrier created by merging Air Canada and Canadian Airlines would use up a large portion of the slots at Toronto ' s airport , particularly during peak hours . 
i think that puts $ 1 billion in perspective . 
when workers are denied EI premiums , small and medium size businesses suffer too . 
this is not to improve it but just to restore it and make up for the money that has not been spent on the highways over the last seven or eight years . 
this week , Senator Gauthier gave me information on the precise nature of Part VII. 
on June 8 , 1999 , the Minister of Justice said in her speech : 
this is not an issue that will be settled by this debate or by the passing of one piece of legislation . 
let us talk about the provinces . 
it creates a fishery that is racist . 
the Canadian group is comprised of officials from the Department of the Solicitor General , which co - chairs the forum with the U.S. Justice Department , the RCMP , the Canadian Security Intelligence Service , Correctional Service Canada , Revenue Canada , the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency , Citizenship and Immigration , Foreign Affairs , the Department of Finance , as well as representatives from provincial governments , including Quebec , and our police forces . 
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) : 
there are days that the debate generates more heat than light , so in that context I would like to at least offer some statistical information with respect to charge rates . 
this is not a debate . 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
i quote the brief on page 5 : 
more shortcomings of CSIS senior managers are being exposed with each passing day . 
i must confess that my attention was drawn to her citation from Sigmund Freud providing an explanation of sociopathic character disorder . 
that is what our government did . 
for the sake of the Nisga ' a and for other bands who entering into negotiations , this cannot happen .

he was retired , while for Ms. Roy the job was a means of supplementing her income and being able to afford some of the niceties . 
those are two obvious threats to health care in the country . 
other statistics tell us that aboriginal people have the highest mortality rate in Canada , at birth , tragically enough , but also as young people . 
that is something to be taken up behind the curtains . 
elections Canada always recommends against a patronage ridden system when it helps developing nations set up their electoral system . 
the maple leaf was a symbol of Canada as early as 1700 , an identification stemming from Canada ' s aboriginal peoples who gathered maple sap every spring . 
frankly , I have no idea who might be named to replace the incumbent . 
( b ) by adding after line 15 on page 108 the following : 
advocates across the country have confirmed to me that we face a desperate shortage of emergency shelters and another winter of death on the streets .

agreed . 
honourable senators , as agreed between both leaders in the Senate , and I hope all senators will be in agreement , I now give the floor to my colleague Senator Jean - Claude Rivest , who will read my speech . 
we cannot deal with water exports because of NAFTA . 
however , we must remember that free trade , despite everything that was said on both sides , was no miracle solution , but is now a vital tool for a country . 
a Predictable Path to Disaster '' . 
unlike the Group No. 1 motions which consisted exclusively of amendments of my Bloc colleague , Group No. 2 motions comprise amendments of a variety of members both from the government and the opposition . 
of course there are exceptions . 
we are going to be watching that very carefully . 
in Holly ' s specific case , in the Canada opportunities strategy we brought in a system whereby single parents will get a $ 3,000 a year grant to go back to university . 
to all these members I say thank you . 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
the Reform Party was screaming , when these people drifted on to the coast of B.C. , to lock them up . 
i have admired Senator Ghitter ' s sincerity and honesty . 
Mr. Charlie Penson 
members 
my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
there is a Canada outside these centres , rural Canada . 
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) : 
i hope that is not the case .

the bill goes on to specify what must be considered by the House of Commons in making the determination on whether a question is clear . 
Mr. Speaker , as the first member of parliament of Latvian heritage it is with great pride that I rise today to congratulate the people of Latvia and all Latvian Canadians on the 81 st anniversary of Latvia ' s declaration of independence . 
nobody wants to stick their neck out to protect somebody that is innocent .

the best examples are some of the things that were in the paper today . 
Mr. Speaker , we have seen the way the minister protects the public interest . 
bill read first time . 
what do the people of my riding want ? 
i will continue to address this issue with him . 
in conclusion , a bill to increase should follow an increase in crime . 
to present things this way is unacceptable . 
Ms. Wendy Lill ( Dartmouth , NDP ) : 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne 
i would have felt even better if it had addressed certain areas of post - secondary education , which the government appears to have completely ignored , and areas that I believe are critical if we are to move forward with knowledge into the 21 st century and not slide backwards or , if we are lucky , simply tread water .

honourable Senator Comeau ) . 
agreed . 
Mr. Speaker : 
the attitude has to change . 
honourable senators , as was said by colleagues on both sides during the emergency debate , the program is not working effectively and must be repaired . 
i am happy to announce today that the two bands which were allowed to fish up to October 31 have agreed to pull all of their traps and fully abide by a regulated fishery . 
the legal aspect will have to be looked at in greater detail in committee . 
that Bill C - 9 be amended by deleting Clause 25 . 
therefore the petition calls upon parliament to use the federal budget for the year 2000 to introduce a multi - year plan to improve the well - being of Canada ' s children . 
it also authorizes the seizure of goods used for gangs ' criminal activities . 
unfortunately , I have the impression that , for political reasons , the justice minister only wishes to show us that she is backing down , or that this is the Liberals ' balanced approach . 
it does not qualify under a proper definition of what an omnibus bill should contain because there is certainly more than one principle contained in this bill . 
let us take these issues seriously . 
they felt that the premiums were too high and the federal government agreed to it .

they had the right to settle in the United States , but not the right to prosper there , to live in peace , the right to happiness and , in particular , to hope . 
our agricultural critics also put forward a minority report in which we listed eight positive things , other than just an ad hoc propping up of the sector , the government could undertake to assist farmers . 
concurrence in Vote 20 a - Agriculture and Agri - Food 
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member . 
i wanted to get the actual text , the 400 pages , and I did not get it until two days before the signing ceremony . 
hon. Charlie Watt , Chair of the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples , presented the following report : 
we must do a better job of dealing with trade issues . 
this is the perception which I hear from NDP members : " If you cannot see the men in droves heading for the pit , the mill or the wharf with their lunch pails in their hands , there must be less people working '' . 
illicit drug use , we know , occurs mostly among children and have - nots . 
nonetheless , even as a point of order , I have heard nothing that would compel me as Speaker to delay the debate on second reading of Bill S - 7 . 
oh , oh . 
it is said that , after taxes , 32.5 % of young people between 18 and 24 have faced poverty for a full year . 
i ask our colleague and the members of the opposition to recognize that we are taking our responsibilities in this respect .

for that reason I cannot support the legislation . 
any third party that spends over $ 500 will have to file a report listing its advertising expenses and contributions . 
i hope that 10 years from now we will look back and , as what the Canadarm did for us in the aerospace industry , our participation in the space station will have brought awareness to Canadian talents and expertise in engineering and so on . 
i advocated to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food to put in place a crop acreage reduction program . 
we are respecting the rights of aboriginal Canadians and all Canadians to live together in peace and harmony in British Columbia and all over our country .

Mr. Speaker , I am pleased today to take part in the Bloc Quebecois opposition day devoted to the airline industry . 
i mention that because he talked about Ottawa , the downsizing of the civil service and how they had to respond to that . 
would the minister confirm that this agreement provides a way around the usual approval process of the Department of Health , despite the fact that Monsanto refused to provide the scientific information vital to the evaluation of its product ?

Mr. Werner Schmidt : 
the subject of the bill or the reading of it is not about families . 
senator DeWare : 
it is a testament to the vision and the leadership of our Prime Minister . 
honourable senators , I give notice that tomorrow , Wednesday , November 17 , 1999 , I will move : 
it was done for prisons , it is going to be done for the fishery , and it was done for free trade . 
i ask the House to join me in congratulating the IODE and wishing all members continuing success in the next 100 years .

another very important part of international economy and the global marketplace is foreign investment . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
perhaps the Liberals do not know this . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
there is the ability for peaceful entry into this industry . 
this has not been slow in terms of months or weeks ; it has been slow for years . 
without property rights , no other rights are possible . 
the second point which I will make is I am amazed again by this study of comparative law . 
it also does not make sense to build a facility from the ground up in relative isolation from major medical centres across the country . 
the Senate met at 2:30 p.m. , the Speaker in the Chair . 
how do we defend that in this day and age ? 
what did the Tories do about the shipbuilding industry when they were in power for nine years ?

i would like to ask , who was approving these grants ? 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) : 
that the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs have power to sit at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday , December 1 , 1999 , even though the Senate may then be sitting , and that rule 95 ( 4 ) be suspended in relation thereto . 
this is not news . 
we ended up in a situation where fisheries managers have to allow the Mi ' kmaq in eastern Canada to fully satisfy their right to fish for a moderate livelihood before anyone else can . 
senator Mahovlich : 
to summarize the match , Guy Lafleur was outstanding in game number one , scoring a hat trick . 
* * * 
the reason for the amendment is that I think there is a very strong ability on the part of the industry committee to deal with the bill in the context of the Competition Act that is law in Canada today . 
it is very interesting . 
Mr. Speaker , the pink ribbon I am wearing today represents breast cancer awareness month . 
one government and a provincial government suggested they did not want to have it for the opportunity of saving money , as the federal government did when it took away its contribution to the GRIP . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Immigration . 
in a system of government based on the rule of law , the laws and regulations created pursuant to its authority to give structure to society have a far reaching and profound impact on the daily lives of citizens . 
for the record , it says that Saskatchewan remains significantly below the previous five year average and is expected to remain significantly below the previous five year average in the year 2000 . 
Canadians do not have a say through their elected representatives because the elected representatives do not insist on having their say . 
the member for Crowfoot , who is a long - standing member of the justice committee , has made many good proposals over the years in this place on this issue . 
it also fails to address the whole aspect of government advertising and the government using taxpayers ' funds to prop itself up and to provide money to its own coffers . 
above all my many experiences here , some of which I enjoyed and some of which I did not , I have learned to respect the members of the Senate of Canada , their work , their commitment to their country , and their recognition of their constitutional responsibilities . 
in 1966 the difference between unemployment in the highest and lowest months was 46 % . 
the system is nothing less than the next generation of the Canadarm , which would help assemble and maintain the space station once in orbit . 
the government changed that recommendation around to make the program fit the budget the minister thought he could get for it , instead of making the program fit the crisis and address the problem . 
this legislation is in line with what is happening elsewhere in the country . 
they do not run candidates themselves , however they may endorse or condemn the stand of a particular candidate or political party . 
for once I hope the Reform Party will recognize this useful spending . 
if there is something that should be close to the Liberal heart , it is Air Canada . 
on October 30 , 1995 my life partner of more than 13 years died . 
Mr. Speaker , in all this business about Human Resources Development Canada , we know that 50 % of program spending was during the 1997 election campaign . 
bill C - 20 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Human Resources Development , who was appointed six months ago , set up all kinds of partisan committees to look at the glaring flaws in the employment insurance program . 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
honourable senators , I should like to ask a question of the Honourable Senator Austin . 
i commit myself , as my social democratic predecessors have done before me , to work tirelessly to achieve these just and time honoured goals . 
however , the Senate proposes that the list of offences to be flagged be incorporated in the act . 
the fact is that we do not even have the proper resources allocated right now in order to protect the stock . 
honourable senators , I understand the honourable senator ' s concerns regarding the overexpenditures of this particular program . 
this policy was developed to help those who are seriously ill and dying .

there is no way we can have taxation without representation . 
the federal government should no more have been in the business of coal mining in Cape Breton than in the business of oil and gas in Alberta .

the Bloc Quebecois agrees in principle with this bill . 
the Deputy Speaker :

this Canadian model is perhaps a good starting point for federations to commence the process of developing or refining the intergovernmental institutions and procedures needed to cope effectively with globalization in the 21 st century . 
i agree that technology is important nowadays , but I do not agree with Cassoulet and his cell phone . 
i am confident that the minister involved will welcome the constructive comments of the Auditor General , and I expect that he will take them into account and act accordingly .

the high - ranking officers responsible for that investigation are completely excluded from the list of those mentioned in the allegations of problems . 
hopefully we would come forward with a bill with less controversial wording and less in need of amendment .

in the meantime , every domestic economy , including Canada ' s , is continually scrutinized by international investors and business people to a depth of detail never before possible . 
from that point of view , it has been a process that has in some ways brought out the best in terms of public debate and certainly has been a model of what negotiation should be about .

the report includes a recommendation in this regard . 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister ' s newfound referendum strategy is as clear as a foggy night . 
we can engage in all kinds of partisan rhetoric .

in the event of a marriage breakdown , a non - aboriginal woman has the protection of the law for access to the marital home and a guarantee that she is half owner of family assets , including the marital home . 
is it any wonder we trail the United States when it comes to productivity ? 
some hon. members : 
can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs tell us when this measure will be introduced in the House ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
a referendum is the desire of the people of British Columbia because of the social implications and the long term implications that this Nisga ' a agreement will have on the province of British Columbia and all of the people who live in the province of British Columbia , native and non - native . 
these 37 cases come from a sampling of 459 cases taken at random from among 30,000 cases . 
honourable senators , I shall now quote judgments in four of these last 39 cases just listed . 
" crossed off the list and , subject to sections 144 and 145 , " 
why do Canadians have to take to the streets to get the Liberal government to listen to them ? 
as Minister of Finance and later as Minister of Health , he found it necessary - as was the case in all the provinces and indeed in the country - to make some very tough decisions . 
as long as we have to argue with them to ensure the unity and the progress of the country , we will continue to promote the democratic tradition that is one of the great achievements of Quebec and of all Canadians . 
the member raised the question that his party raised . 
i know there will be a future on Cape Breton Island because unlike the government I believe in the people of the island . 
minister OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
however , it is subject to competing claims of ownership by the Gitanyow people , whose hereditary chiefs appeared before the House of Commons committee to explain the dispute . 
we want tax cuts for those who contributed most to helping the federal government eliminate the deficit . 
that means three times that amount are needed to maintain that 4,500 figure . 
it has been a ride over bad roads too , but that is another issue . 
it is regrettable in the extreme the federal government did not have the foresight to at least take under serious advisement the urgings of the Mi ' kmaq leadership to anticipate the outcome of the decision . 
i was not attached to anyone , I was there to defend the public interest , and I think it is the only way to protect democracy . 
there are no cultural conditions attached to this . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
last spring the government gave the Labour Minister a mandate to find a solution , and she was supposed to derive a strategy within a month . 
the fact of the matter is that Mr. Black was recommended for a non - hereditary life peerage and , in my opinion , that is a noble aspiration . 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
now the government has the opportunity to help with this public awareness campaign by recognizing June as leukemia awareness month . 
we discussed what the order would be . 
manslaughter is a lesser and included offence as compared to premeditated murder . 
the other amendments to this act will clarify and strengthen the existing regime on the collecting of samples of bodily substances . 
what is most alarming is the growing number of children living in poverty . 
i will continue to demand from the government that we work with the stakeholders to come to an acceptable solution of this serious issue . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
it represents a forced marriage of two bills on two rather different , almost unrelated subjects . 
i draw to your attention that my hon. colleague spilled a large amount of water on my chair and I am therefore denied the opportunity to take my seat in this House . 
the bill expands the definition of anti - competitive act currently listed in section 78 . 
he also mentioned the Libman decision . 
or are we going to come up with legal creations which are not anchored in reality ? 
we are used to that here . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i understand that during the provincial part of this whole discussion , the province had 27 different meetings in different communities in British Columbia . 
his 40 years of dedication to the fundamental principle of respect for the history of our country and for the unique nature of our two founding cultures will serve us well in this inquiry .

i agree that decorum is a bulwark of democracy . 
we have to look at the long - term implications .

i would have thought that would be the kind of policy that the Conservative Party would be interested in seeing so it could resolve the mess that it caused in its time in office .

Mr. Speaker , it is simply not true that those beds are no longer needed . 
however , I think I have had sufficient experience to understand something of the mandarin and , indeed , the political mind . 
the manner in which consent is to be given is governed by the regulations . 
is that agreed ? 
... you asked for my views on the question as to whether the Nisga ' a treaty creates an " exclusive " fishery contrary to the Magna Carta .

i am not familiar with the issue of five - year averaging , but the senator makes an articulate and reasoned case . 
that is a step in the right direction . 
he spoke for all who have faced their soul in the finality of the theatre of war , whether Korea , the gulf or the two world wars . 
but to suggest that because an auditor requested to come in by the Government of Canada has identified some problems in the files and that a cabinet minister needs to step aside over that is political hysteria . 
these cuts are shocking , revolting , disgusting , odious and not worthy of any government . 
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
instead , the parties involved know the limitations imposed and must work within such a framework to establish an agreement that satisfies not only the court ' s requirements but the objectives of each party . 
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) : 
honourable senators , my question is supplementary to the comments of the minister , particularly those with respect to the position of the provincial government . 
mike Harris thought that the best way to deal with a difficult political policy issue was to empty the legislature and have first , second and third readings all on the same day .

she was paid this tribute in Rome by a jury comprising representatives of Italy , Spain , France , Romania , Brazil , Colombia and Quebec . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard 
honourable senators , we are both Montrealers . 
we want to set the record straight by reminding the minister that a recent poll conducted by the research and information centre on Canada , or CRIC , shows that only 13 % of Quebecers support the status quo . 
in 1973 , the supreme court issued the Calder decision . 
can we imagine the howls of derision from members on that side of the House , or from that member when she was on the other side the House , if the government unilaterally gave away the fishing rights to the aboriginals ? 
yeas 
however , we should have been back here September 1 , not the middle of October . 
the only thing the bill is very clear about is that the question could not envisage other possibilities in addition to the secession of the province from Canada , such as economic or political arrangements with Canada , that obscure a direct expression of the will of the population of that province on whether the province should cease to be part of Canada . 
to recognize and celebrate the lives of those who died for Canada is not to celebrate war . 
Mr. Speaker , I say again that the riding did qualify as a result of Statistics Canada numbers .
